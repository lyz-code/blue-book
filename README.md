# [The Blue Book](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book)

This is my personal wiki where I share [everything
I know](everything_i_know.md) about this world in form of an [online
mkdocs book](https://www.mkdocs.org/) hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book).

**The wiki is meant to be read [in the web
format](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book).**

## Contributing
