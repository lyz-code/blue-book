# [The Blue Book](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book)

This is my personal wiki where I share everything
I know about this world in form of an [online
mkdocs book](https://www.mkdocs.org/) hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book).

**The wiki is meant to be read [in the web
format](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book).**

## Contributing

If you find a mistake or want to add new content, please make the changes. You
can use the edit button on the top right of any article to add them in a pull

[issue](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book/issues/new) or send me an
[email](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/contact/).
