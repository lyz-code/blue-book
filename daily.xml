      <description>&lt;article class=&#34;md-content__inner md-typeset&#34;&gt;  &lt;h2 id=&#34;militancy&#34;&gt;Militancy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;collaborating-tools&#34;&gt;Collaborating tools&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;aleph&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/investigative_journalism/&#34;&gt;Aleph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: Add warning for new potential users.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;WARNING: Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/investigative_journalism/&#34;&gt;investigative journalism article before using Aleph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: Compare investigative journalism tools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After reviewing Aleph Pro, Open Aleph, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataresearchcenter.org/&#34;&gt;DARC&lt;/a&gt; and Datashare I feel that the investigative reporting software environment, as of June 2025, is very brittle and under a huge crisis that will have a breaking point on October of 2025, day where OCCRP will do the switch from Aleph to Aleph Pro.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given this scenario, I think the best thing to do, if you already have an Aleph instance, is to keep using it until things stabilise. As you won\&#39;t have software updates since October 2025, I suggest that from then on you protect the service behind an VPN and/or SSL client certificate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also feel it\&#39;s also a great moment to make a strategic decision on how you want to use an investigative reporting platform. Some key questions are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;How much do you care of our data being leaked or lost by third parties?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How much do you trust OCCRP, DARC or ICIJ?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Do you want to switch from a self hosted platform to an external managed one? Will they be able to give a better service?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If you want to stay on the self hosted solution. Shall you migrate to Datashare instead of Open Aleph?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How dependent are you on open source software? How fragile are the teams that support that software? Can you help change that fragility?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Shall you use the AI for your investigative processes? If so, where and when?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hope the analysis below may help shed some light on some of these questions. The only one that is not addressed is the AI as it\&#39;s a more political, philosophical one, that would make the document even longer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis of the present&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development dependent in US government&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two main software are developed by non-profits, Aleph by OCCRP and Datashare by ICIJ, that received part of their funding from the US government. This funding was lost after Naranjitler\&#39;s administration funding cuts:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.occrp.org/en/feature/with-a-strike-of-a-pen-trumps-aid-cuts-threaten-independent-journalism-around-the-world&#34;&gt;OCCRP lost this year 38% of their operational funds&lt;/a&gt;: \&#34;As a result, we had to lay off 40 people --- one fifth of our staff --- and have temporarily reduced some of the salaries of others. But there is more. OCCRP has also been funding a number of organizations across Europe, in some of the most difficult countries. Eighty percent of those sub-grants that we provide to other newsrooms have been cut as well.\&#34;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icij.org/news/2025/03/unable-to-stay-in-the-country-unable-to-return-home-reporters-face-grim-prospects-after-latest-trump-cuts/&#34;&gt;ICIJ lost this year 8.6% of their operational funds&lt;/a&gt; with no apparent effects on the software or the staff.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OCCRP decided to close the source code of Aleph triggering the team split up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.occrp.org/en/announcement/occrp-announces-a-new-chapter-for-its-investigative-data-platform-aleph-pro&#34;&gt;OCCRP decision to close the source of Aleph&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataresearchcenter.org/who-we-are/&#34;&gt;important part of their team&lt;/a&gt; (the co-leader of the research and data team, the Chief Data Editor and a developer) decided to &lt;a href=&#34;https://openaleph.org/blog/2025/03/OpenAleph-commits-to-the-commons/3510138e-16b3-4b5d-a06c-41af0aa2d517/&#34;&gt;leave the project&lt;/a&gt; and fund &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataresearchcenter.org&#34;&gt;DARC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although they look to &lt;a href=&#34;https://openaleph.org/blog/2025/03/OpenAleph-commits-to-the-commons/3510138e-16b3-4b5d-a06c-41af0aa2d517/&#34;&gt;be in good terms&lt;/a&gt;. They\&#39;re collaborating, although it could be OCCRP trying to save their face on this dark turn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These software have very few developers and no community behind them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alephdata/aleph/graphs/contributors&#34;&gt;Aleph&lt;/a&gt; looks to be currently developed by 2 developers, and it\&#39;s development has stagnated since the main developer (`pudo`) stopped developing and moved to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/opensanctions/opensanctions/graphs/contributors&#34;&gt;Open Sanctions&lt;/a&gt; 4 years ago. 3 key members of their team have moved on to Open Aleph after the split. We can only guess if this is the same team that is developing Aleph Pro. If it\&#39;s not then they are developers we know nothing about and can\&#39;t audit.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alephdata/aleph/compare/main...openaleph:openaleph:main&#34;&gt;Open Aleph&lt;/a&gt; looks to be developed by 4 people, 3 of them were part of the Aleph development team until the break up. The other one created a company to host Aleph instances 4 years ago.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ICIJ/datashare/graphs/contributors&#34;&gt;Datashare&lt;/a&gt; seems to be developed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icij.org/about/our-team/&#34;&gt;6 developers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;In all projects pull requests by the community have been very scarce.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The community support is not that great&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My experience requesting features, proposing fixes with Aleph before the split is that they answer well on their slack, but are slow on the issues and the pull requests that fall outside their planned roadmap. Even if they are bugs. I\&#39;ve been running a script on each ingest to fix an UI bug for a year already. I tried to work with them in solving it without success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don\&#39;t have experience with Datashare, but they do answer and fix the issues the people open.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis of the available software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aleph Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The analysis is based on their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.occrp.org/en/announcement/occrp-announces-a-new-chapter-for-its-investigative-data-platform-aleph-pro&#34;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.occrp.org/en/announcement/aleph-pro-frequently-asked-questions-on-the-future-of-occrps-investigative-data-platform&#34;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;As long as you have less than 1TB of data and are a nonprofit it will, for now, cost you way less than hosting your solution&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;OCCRP is behind the project&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;They seem to have an unstable, small and broken development team&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;They only offer 1TB of data which is enough for small to medium projects but doesn\&#39;t give much space to grow&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;They lost my trust&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are several reasons that make me hesitant to trust them:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;They don\&#39;t want to publish their source code&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;They decided that the path to solve a complicated financial situation is to close their source code&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;They advocated in the past (and even now!) that being open-sourced was a corner part of the project and yet they close their code.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;They hid that &lt;a href=&#34;https://report.az/en/analytics/independent-investigation-us-gov-t-funded-occrp-and-appointed-its-leadership/&#34;&gt;52% of their funding came from the US government&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the next consequences:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;I would personally not give them my data or host their software.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I wouldn\&#39;t be surprised if in the future they retract on their promises, such as offering Aleph Pro for free forever for nonprofit journalism organizations.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You loose sovereignty of your data&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Either if you upload your data to their servers or host a closed sourced program in yours, you have no way of knowing what are they doing with your data. Given their economical situation, doing business with the data could be an option.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It could also be potentially difficult to extract your data in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You loose sovereignty of your service&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If they host the service you depend on them for any operations such as maintenance, upgrades, and keeping the service up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You\&#39;ll also no longer be able to change the software to apply patches to problems and would depend on them for their implementation and application.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You\&#39;ll no longer have any easy way to know what does the program do. This is critical from a security point of view as introduced backdoors would go unnoticed. It\&#39;s also worrying as we could not audit how they implement the AI. It is known that AI solutions tend to be biased and may thwart the investigative process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, if they decide to shutdown or change the conditions you\&#39;re sold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;I looks like they are selling smoke&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their development activity has dropped in the recent years, they have a weakened team and yet they are promising a complete rewrite to create a brand new software. In an announce that is filled with buzzwords such as AI without giving any solid evidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel that the whole announcement is written to urge people to buy their product and to save their face. Its not written to the community or their users, is for those that can give them money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;They offer significant performance upgrades and lower infrastructure costs at the same time that they incorporate the latest developments in data-analysis and AI&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Depending on how they materialise the data-analysis and AI new features it will mean a small to a great increase in infrastructure costs. Hosting these processes is very resource intensive and expensive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The decrease in infra costs may come from:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Hosting many aleph instances under the same infrastructure is more efficient than each organisation having their own.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;They might migrate the code to a more efficient language like rust or go&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;So even though Aleph Pro will require more resources, as they are all going to be hosted in OCCRP it will be cheaper overall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I\&#39;m not sure how they want to implement the AI, I see two potential places:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;To improve the ingest process.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;To use LLM (like ChatGPT) to query the data.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both features are very, very, very expensive resource wise. The only way to give those features at the same time as lowering the infra costs is by outsourcing the AI services. If they do this, it will mean that your data will be processed by that third party, with all the awful consequences it entails.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are selling existent features as new or are part of other open source projects&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such as:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Rebuilt the ingest pipeline: they recently released it in the latest versions of Aleph&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Modular design: The source is already modular (although it can always be improved)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Enhanced data models for better linking, filtering, and insights. Their model is based on followthemoney which is open source.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are ditching part of their user base&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They only support self-hosted solutions to enterprise license clients. This leaves out small organisations or privacy minded individuals. Even this solution is said to be maintained in partnership with OCCRP.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new version benefits may not be worth the costs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They say that Aleph Pro will deliver a faster, smarter, and more flexible platform, combining a modern technical foundation with user-centered design and major performance gains. But if you do not do a heavy use of the service you may not need some of these improvements. Although they for sure would be nice to have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It could be unstable for a while&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A complete platform rewrite is usually good in the long run but these kind of migrations tend to have an unstable period of time where some of the functionality might be missing&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You need to make the decision blindly&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though they are going to give a beta if you request it, I\&#39;m not sure of this, before doing the switch, you need to make the decision beforehand. You may not even like the new software&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Datashare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;ICIJ, a more reliable non profit, is behind it.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Has the biggest and stable development team&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Is the most active project&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Better community support&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You can host it&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It\&#39;s open source&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;If you have an Aleph instance there is no documented way to migrate to Datashare. And there is still not an easy way to do the migration, as they don&#39;t yet use the &lt;code&gt;followthemoney&lt;/code&gt; data schema.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;They won\&#39;t host an instance for you.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Aleph&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;You can host it&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It\&#39;s open source&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The hosted solution will probably cost you way less than hosting your own solution (although &lt;a href=&#34;https://openaleph.org/managed/&#34;&gt;they don\&#39;t show prices&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The people behind it have proven their ethic values&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I know one of their developers. She is a fantastic person which is very involved in putting technology in the service of society, and has been active at the CCC.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;They are actively reaching out to give support with the migration&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;A new small organisation is behind the project&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A small development team with few recent activity. Since their creation (3 months ago) their development &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openaleph/openaleph/pulse/monthly&#34;&gt;pace is slow&lt;/a&gt; (the contributors don\&#39;t even load). It could be because they are still setting up the new organisation and doing the fork.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It may not have all the features Aleph has. They started the fork on November of 2024 and are 137 commits ahead and 510 behind. But they could be squash commits.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Their &lt;a href=&#34;https://darc.social/&#34;&gt;community forum&lt;/a&gt; doesn\&#39;t have much activity&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The remote hosted solution has the same problems as Aleph Pro in terms of data and service sovereignty. Although I do trust more DARC than OCCRP.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 id=&#34;life-navigation&#34;&gt;Life navigation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;time-navigation&#34;&gt;Time navigation&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;org-mode&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/orgmode/&#34;&gt;Org Mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/orgmode/#exporting&#34;&gt;Exporting to pdf or markdown.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To pdf&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to convert it with python you first need to install the dependencies: &lt;code&gt;sudo apt install texlive-xetex&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then you can do&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To markdown&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;input.org&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-o&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;output.md

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replace a bitnami image with a local one&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you for some reason need to pull &lt;code&gt;bitnami/discourse:3.4.7&lt;/code&gt; and get an error you need instead to pull it from &lt;code&gt;{your_registry}/bitnami/discourse:3.4.7&lt;/code&gt;. If you want to pull a specific architecture you can append it at the end (&lt;code&gt;{your_registry}/bitnami/discourse:3.4.7-amd64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you need to do the changes in an argocd managed kubernetes application search in the &lt;code&gt;values.yaml&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;values-{environment}.yaml&lt;/code&gt; files for the &lt;code&gt;image:&lt;/code&gt; string. If it&#39;s not defined you may need to look at the helm chart definition. To do that open the &lt;code&gt;Chart.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file to find the chart and the version used. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;apiVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain&#34;&gt;v2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain&#34;&gt;discourse&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain&#34;&gt;1.0.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;dependencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p p-Indicator&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain&#34;&gt;discourse&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain&#34;&gt;12.6.2&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can pull a local copy of the chart with:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;If the chart is using an &lt;code&gt;oci&lt;/code&gt; url:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;helm&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pull&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/postgresql&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--version&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;.10.X&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--untar&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-d&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;postgres8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;If it&#39;s using an &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; url:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;helm&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pull&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;cost-analyzer&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--repo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;https://kubecost.github.io/cost-analyzer/&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--version&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;.7.2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;And inspect the &lt;code&gt;values.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file and all the templates until you find which key value you need to add.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;feat(docker#Cannot invoke &#34;jdk.internal.platform.CgroupInfo.getMountPoint()&#34; because &#34;anyController&#34; is null) : Cannot invoke &#34;jdk.internal.platform.CgroupInfo.getMountPoint()&#34; because &#34;anyController&#34; is null&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s caused because the docker is not able to access the cgroups, this can be caused by a docker using the legacy cgroups v1 while the linux kernel (&amp;gt;6.12) is using the v2.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best way to fix it is to upgrade the docker to use v2, if you can&#39;t you need to force the system to use the v1. To do that:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Edit &lt;code&gt;/etc/default/grub&lt;/code&gt; to add the configuration &lt;code&gt;GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=&#34;systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0&#34;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Then update GRUB: &lt;code&gt;sudo update-grub&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reboot&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/gitea/#clone-al-git-repositories-of-a-series-of-organisations&#34;&gt;Clone al git repositories of a series of organisations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It assumes you have &lt;code&gt;tea&lt;/code&gt; configured to interact with the desired gitea instance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-e

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Graceful Node Removal (Recommended)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, try the standard approach:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;drain&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;node-name&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--ignore-daemonsets&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--delete-emptydir-data

kubectl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;delete&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;node&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;node-name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Force Removal When Node is Unresponsive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the node is unresponsive or the graceful removal fails:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;drain&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;node-name&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--ignore-daemonsets&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--delete-emptydir-data&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--force&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--grace-period&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

In those cases use a broader search that includes other logs and the &lt;code&gt;unless&lt;/code&gt; operator:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;(sum by(hostname) (count_over_time({job=&#34;systemd-journal&#34;} [1h]))
unless
sum by(hostname) (count_over_time({service_name=&#34;watchtower&#34;} [1d]))) &amp;gt; 0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This will return a value &amp;gt; 0 for any hostname that has systemd-journal logs but no watchtower logs in the past day, which is perfect for alerting conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/postgres/#upgrade-postgres&#34;&gt;Upgrade postgres.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/troubleshooting/postgres/upgrade_docker&#34;&gt;Using dump and import&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dump your database&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dump your existing database with a command similar to &lt;code&gt;docker compose exec postgresql pg_dump -U authentik -d authentik -cC &amp;gt; upgrade_backup_12.sql&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before continuing, ensure the SQL dump file &lt;code&gt;upgrade_backup_12.sql&lt;/code&gt; includes all your database content.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop your application stack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stop all services with &lt;code&gt;docker compose down&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backup your existing database&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Move the directory where your data is to a new one: &lt;code&gt;mv /path/to/database /path/to/v12-backup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modify your docker-compose.yml file&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Update the PostgreSQL service image from &lt;code&gt;docker.io/library/postgres:12-alpine&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;docker.io/library/postgres:17-alpine&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;network_mode: none&lt;/code&gt; and comment out any &lt;code&gt;network&lt;/code&gt; directive to prevent connections being established to the database during the upgrade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recreate the database container&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pull new images and re-create the PostgreSQL container: &lt;code&gt;docker compose pull &amp;amp;&amp;amp; docker compose up --force-recreate -d postgresql&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apply your backup to the new database: &lt;code&gt;cat upgrade_backup_12.sql | docker compose exec -T postgresql psql -U authentik&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remove the network configuration setting &lt;code&gt;network_mode: none&lt;/code&gt; that you added to the Compose file in the previous step.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring the service up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Start again the service with &lt;code&gt;docker compose up&lt;/code&gt; and see that everything is working as expected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;openzfs&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/linux/zfs/&#34;&gt;OpenZFS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/linux/zfs/#monitor-the-zfs-ram-usage&#34;&gt;Monitor the zfs ram usage.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p p-Indicator&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain&#34;&gt;HostOutOfMemory&lt;/span&gt;

This guide explores the best open-source and privacy-focused keyboard options available for Android devices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Gboard users transitioning&lt;/strong&gt;: HeliBoard&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For advanced features and AI&lt;/strong&gt;: FUTO Keyboard&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For unique input method&lt;/strong&gt;: Thumb-Key&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For future consideration&lt;/strong&gt;: FlorisBoard (when stable)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUTO Keyboard ⭐ Recommended&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;FUTO represents the cutting edge of privacy-focused keyboard technology, incorporating AI features while maintaining offline functionality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Makes FUTO Special&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;FUTO stands out with &lt;strong&gt;transformer-based predictions&lt;/strong&gt; using llama.cpp and &lt;strong&gt;integrated voice input&lt;/strong&gt; powered by whisper.cpp. Unlike other keyboards that require proprietary libraries, FUTO includes swipe/glide typing by default.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The keyboard is currently in pre-alpha, so expect some bugs and missing features. However, the privacy-preserving approach and innovative AI integration make it worth trying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart Text Prediction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Uses pre-trained transformer models for intelligent autocorrect&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Personal language model that learns from your typing (locally only)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Currently optimized for English, with other languages in development&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Spanish support is still limited&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy-First Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;All AI processing happens on-device&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Your data never leaves your phone&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;FUTO doesn&#39;t view or store any typing data&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Internet access only for updates and crash reporting (planned to be removed)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customization Options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Multilingual typing support&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Custom keyboard layouts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Swipe typing works well out of the box&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pre-alpha software with occasional bugs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Limited language support beyond English&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Uses a custom &#34;Source First&#34; license (not traditional open source)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Screen movement issues when using swipe typing&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Licensing Concerns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;FUTO uses a custom license rather than traditional open source licenses like GPL. While the source code is available, the licensing terms are more restrictive than typical open source projects. The team promises to adopt proper open source licensing eventually, but this transition hasn&#39;t happened yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://keyboard.futo.org/&#34;&gt;Official Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.keyboard.futo.org/&#34;&gt;Documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.futo.org/alex/voiceinput&#34;&gt;Source Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://privseclaw.info/posts/futokeyboard/&#34;&gt;Privacy Analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not there yet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The futo voice has a weird bug at least in spanish that sometimes adds at the end of the transcription phrases like: Subscribe! or Chau or Thanks for watching my video!. This is kind of annoying and scary &lt;code&gt;(¬º-°)¬&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HeliBoard - The Reliable Choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HeliBoard serves as an excellent middle ground, especially for users transitioning from Gboard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Choose HeliBoard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active development&lt;/strong&gt;: Fork of OpenBoard with regular updates&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No network access&lt;/strong&gt;: Completely offline operation&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User-friendly&lt;/strong&gt;: Much simpler than AnySoftKeyboard&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gboard-like experience&lt;/strong&gt;: Familiar interface for Google Keyboard users&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trade-offs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main limitation is glide typing, which requires a closed-source library. This compromises the fully open source nature but provides the swipe functionality many users expect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard&#34;&gt;GitHub Repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thumb-Key - The Innovative Alternative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For users willing to try something completely different, Thumb-Key offers a unique approach to mobile typing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Thumb-Key Concept&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of traditional QWERTY, Thumb-Key uses a &lt;strong&gt;3x3 grid layout&lt;/strong&gt; with swipe gestures for less common letters. This design prioritizes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Large, predictable key positions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Muscle memory development&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Eyes staying on the text area&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fast typing speeds once mastered&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best For&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Users open to learning new input methods&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Those who prefer larger touch targets&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Privacy enthusiasts who want to avoid predictive text entirely&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;People who find traditional keyboards cramped&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The keyboard is highly configurable and focuses on accuracy through key positioning rather than AI predictions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dessalines/thumb-key&#34;&gt;GitHub Repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FlorisBoard - Future Potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;FlorisBoard shows promise but isn&#39;t ready for daily use yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Status&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Early beta development&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Planned integration with GrapheneOS&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Missing key features like suggestions and glide typing&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Limited documentation available&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worth Watching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While not currently recommended for primary use, FlorisBoard could become a strong contender once it reaches stability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard&#34;&gt;GitHub Repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://florisboard.org/&#34;&gt;Official Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative Approaches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexpected Keyboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A minimalist keyboard with a unique layout approach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Julow/Unexpected-Keyboard&#34;&gt;GitHub Repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Proprietary Keyboards with Restrictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On privacy-focused ROMs like GrapheneOS and DivestOS, you can use proprietary keyboards while blocking internet access. However, this approach has limitations due to inter-process communication between apps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: This method isn&#39;t foolproof, as apps can still potentially communicate through IPC mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Current Setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After testing various options:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary choice&lt;/strong&gt;: FUTO Keyboard with swipe enabled&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backup plan&lt;/strong&gt;: Try FUTO voice input for longer texts when privacy features improve&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative&lt;/strong&gt;: Thumb-Key if FUTO doesn&#39;t work out&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main issue encountered is screen movement during swipe typing, which may be device-specific.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References and Further Reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://discuss.privacyguides.net/t/recommend-open-source-android-keyboards/17808/36&#34;&gt;Privacy Guides Discussion on Android Keyboards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://discuss.privacyguides.net/t/futo-keyboard/18896&#34;&gt;FUTO Keyboard Community Discussion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/2810&#34;&gt;GrapheneOS IPC Communication Issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 id=&#34;filosofia&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/filosof%C3%ADa/&#34;&gt;Filosofía&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/filosof%C3%ADa/#tiempo&#34;&gt;Nuevos capítulos relevantes sobre el tiempo y otras cosas.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://traffic.megaphone.fm/PMSL8763758424.mp3?updated=1712825949&#34;&gt;Punzadas Sonoras: Mirar atrás: un gesto íntimo&lt;/a&gt;: Ruptura de la concepción lineal del tiempo, aplicado entre otras cosas a las relaciones.

For example in the case of a docker container (named &lt;code&gt;dawarich_app&lt;/code&gt;) you can:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;truncate&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-s&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/var/lib/docker/containers/&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;docker&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;inspect&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-f&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;{{.Id}}&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;dawarich_app&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;docker&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;inspect&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-f&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;{{.Id}}&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;dawarich_app&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;-json.log
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/loki/#ingestion-rate-limit-exceeded-for-user&#34;&gt;Ingestion rate limit exceeded for user.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Increase rate limits in Loki config:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;limits_config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also check which logs are triggering this rate limit because it may be the case that the amount of logs is too great due to an error.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;debugging&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/kubernetes_debugging/&#34;&gt;Debugging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/kubernetes_debugging/#pvc-or-pv-is-stuck-deleting&#34;&gt;PVC or PV is stuck deleting.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When PVs and PVCs get stuck during deletion, it&#39;s usually due to finalizers that prevent the cleanup process from completing. Here are several approaches to resolve this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check for Finalizers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, examine what&#39;s preventing the deletion:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;get&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pv&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;pv-name&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-o&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;yaml&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;grep&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;finalizers&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-A&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
kubectl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;get&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pvc&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;pvc-name&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-n&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;namespace&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-o&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;yaml&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;grep&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;finalizers&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-A&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remove Finalizers (Most Common Solution)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you see finalizers like &lt;code&gt;kubernetes.io/pv-protection&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;kubernetes.io/pvc-protection&lt;/code&gt;, you can remove them:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;patch&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pvc&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;pvc-name&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-n&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;namespace&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-p&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;{&#34;metadata&#34;:{&#34;finalizers&#34;:null}}&#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;When building your docker image, using the naming convention above, this looks like:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;build&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-t&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;registry&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;owner&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;image&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;tag&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;.

docker&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tag&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;some-existing-image&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;tag&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;registry&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;owner&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;image&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;tag&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Where your registry is the domain of your forgejo instance (e.g. forgejo.example.com). For example, these are all valid image names for the owner testuser:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;forgejo.example.com/testuser/myimage&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;forgejo.example.com/testuser/my-image&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;forgejo.example.com/testuser/my/image&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;NOTE: The registry only supports case-insensitive tag names. So image:tag and image:Tag get treated as the same image and tag.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push an image&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Push an image by executing the following command:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;push&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;forgejo.example.com/&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;owner&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;image&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;tag&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;push&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;forgejo.example.com/testuser/myimage:latest

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This assumes that your cron runs /bin/sh, which is the default regardless of the user&#39;s default shell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Footnote: if env contains more advanced config, eg &lt;code&gt;PS1=$(__git_ps1 &#34; (%s)&#34;)$&lt;/code&gt;, it will error cryptically &lt;code&gt;env: &#34;: No such file or directory&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;wireguard&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/wg-easy/&#34;&gt;Wireguard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: More wg-easy configurations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy/wiki/Using-WireGuard-Easy-with-Ansible&#34;&gt;configure with ansible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy/pull/737&#34;&gt;Split tunneling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind though that the &lt;code&gt;WG_ALLOWED_IPS&lt;/code&gt; only sets the routes on the client, it does not limit the traffic at server level. For example, if you set &lt;code&gt;172.30.1.0/24&lt;/code&gt; as the allowed ips, but the client changes it to &lt;code&gt;172.30.0.0/16&lt;/code&gt; it will be able to access for example &lt;code&gt;172.30.2.1&lt;/code&gt;. The suggested way to prevent this behavior is to add the kill switch in the Pre and Post hooks (&lt;code&gt;WG_POST_UP&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WG_POST_DOWN&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy/wiki/Restrict-Access-to-Networks-with-iptables&#34;&gt;Restrict Access to Networks with iptables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you need to restrict many networks you can use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.procustodibus.com/blog/2021/03/wireguard-allowedips-calculator/&#34;&gt;this allowed ips calculator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://airvpn.org/forums/topic/50601-kill-switch-settings-for-wireguard-on-ubuntu-20/&#34;&gt;Kill switch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitorization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to use the prometheus metrics &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy/issues/1373&#34;&gt;you need to use a version greater than 14&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;code&gt;15&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy/pkgs/container/wg-easy/versions&#34;&gt;not yet released&lt;/a&gt; (as of 2025-03-20) I&#39;m using &lt;code&gt;nightly&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can enable them with the environment variable &lt;code&gt;ENABLE_PROMETHEUS_METRICS=true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scrape the metrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Add to your scrape config the required information&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p p-Indicator&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;job_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain&#34;&gt;vpn-admin&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Download &lt;code&gt;firmware.rock64-rk3328.img.gz&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;partition.img.gz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Combine the 2 parts into 1 image file: &lt;code&gt;zcat

Replace &lt;code&gt;/dev/sda&lt;/code&gt; with your target drive.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Plug the microSD/eMMC card in the Rock64 (and connect a serial console, or keyboard and monitor) and boot up to start the Debian Installer&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;An Ethernet connection is required for the above installer&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Remember to leave some space before your first partition for u-boot! You can do this by creating a 32M size unused partition at the start of the device.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Auto creating all partitions does not work. You can use the following manual partition scheme:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt; #1 - 34MB  Unused/Free Space
 #2 - 512MB ext2 /boot           (Remember to set the bootable flag)
 #3 - xxGB  ext4 /               (This can be as large as you want. You can also create separate partitions for /home /var /tmp)
 #4 - 1GB   swap                 (May not be a good idea if using an SD card)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;software-tools&#34;&gt;Software tools&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;liberaforms&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/liberaforms/&#34;&gt;Liberaforms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: Usage of liberaforms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marked true&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are a forms admin you can mark the answers which can be used to for example state that those have been checked and are not trolls, the user can then edit the answers through the magic link but it&#39;s not very probable that it becomes a trollo&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send edit email&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want the users to receive an email with the magic link so that they can edit their answers you need to add a &#34;Short text&#34; field of type &#34;Email&#34; and then in the Options you need to enable the setting to send the users the magic link&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extract the results through API&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each form at the bottom of the Options tab has a section of API endpoints, once enabled you can extract them with curl:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;BASE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;https://forms.komun.org

If you want to use sqlite just remove the database configuration.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I was not able to find the default admin user so I had to create it manually. Get into the docker:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-it&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pretalx&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you run the commands by default it uses another database file &lt;code&gt;/pretalx/src/data/db.sqlite3&lt;/code&gt;, so I removed it and created a symbolic link to the actual place of the database &lt;code&gt;/data/db.sqlite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pretalxuser@82f886a58c57:/$&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;rm&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/pretalx/src/data/db.sqlite3

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then you can create the admin user:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;python&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-m&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pretalx&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;createsuperuser

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem is that this method does not respect the version constrains nor the injects, so you may need to debug each package a bit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;configure-docker-to-host-the-application&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/docker/&#34;&gt;Configure Docker to host the application&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/docker/#limit-the-access-of-a-docker-on-a-server-to-the-access-on-the-docker-of-another-server&#34;&gt;Limit the access of a docker on a server to the access on the docker of another server.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;WARNING: I had issues with this path and I ended up not using docker swarm networks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to restrict access to a docker (running on server 1) so that only another specific docker container running on another server (server 2) can access it. You need more than just IP-based filtering between hosts. The solution is then to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Create a Docker network that spans both hosts using Docker Swarm or a custom overlay network.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Docker&#39;s built-in DNS resolution&lt;/strong&gt; to allow specific container-to-container communication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a step-by-step approach:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Set up Docker Swarm (if not already done)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On server 1:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;swarm&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;init&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--advertise-addr&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;ip&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;of&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;server&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This will output a command to join the swarm. Run that command on server 2.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Create an overlay network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;network&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;create&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--driver&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;overlay&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--attachable&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;name&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;of&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;the&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;network&amp;gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain&#34;&gt;your-client-image&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;container_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain&#34;&gt;wg-client&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;networks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p p-Indicator&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;name of the network&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Other configuration for your client container&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;networks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;name of the network&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;external&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Reference the same overlay network&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Access the WireGuard interface from the client container&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, from within the client container on server 2, you can access the WireGuard interface using the container name:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://wg-easy:51821
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This approach ensures that:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;The WireGuard web interface is not exposed to the public (not even localhost on server 1)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Only containers on the shared overlay network can access it&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The specific container on server 2 can access it using Docker&#39;s internal DNS&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing the network is well set&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may be confused if the new network is not shown on server 2 when running &lt;code&gt;docker network ls&lt;/code&gt; but that&#39;s normal. Server 2 is a swarm worker node. The issue with not seeing the overlay network on server 2 is actually expected behavior - worker nodes cannot list or manage networks directly. However, even though you can&#39;t see them, containers on the server 2 can still connect to the overlay network when properly configured.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To see that the swarm is well set you can use &lt;code&gt;docker node ls&lt;/code&gt; on server 1 (you&#39;ll see an error on server 2 as it&#39;s a worker node)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weird network issues with swarm overlays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve seen cases where after a server reboot you need to remove the overlay network from the docker compose and then add it again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After many hours of debugging I came with the patch of removing the overlay network from the docker-compose and attaching it with the systemd service&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Unit]

No sólo porque extraen información de los colectivos sino porque generan un ambiente de desconfianza y miedo que muchas veces es paralizante o incluso desarticula los propios colectivos. De la peor escoria de la sociedad...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Por desgracia, en el estado español &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elsaltodiario.com/montajes-policiales&#34;&gt;está bastante de moda&lt;/a&gt;. Por suerte no estamos desamparadas, varias compañeras están generando materiales para familiarizarnos con este problema.

It fosters internal harmony and serves as a behavioral compass, enabling individuals to orient themselves towards the future and establish long-term goals. As an active process, it profoundly influences an individual&#39;s capacity to adapt to life events and achieve a state of well-being. However, identity originates from traits or attributes that you may have little or no control over, such as their family background or ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Identities then will be the guide of my life. I&#39;ve tried setting essential goals, answering big questions with no success so far. This approach however looks more interesting because:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;I can split myself in many identities each with it&#39;s definition and analyse life through the different lenses, identify identity conflicts, priorize identities...&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I can analyse each identity on it&#39;s own, decide how to change my roadmap to integrate the ones I want to adopt and get away from the ones I want to leave behind.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It reminds me of the RPG character building and although it may seem silly, that motivates me.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It fits quite well with what I&#39;ve learnt regarding &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/habit_management/&#34;&gt;habit management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The identities archive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&#39;m using a new notebook page called &lt;code&gt;identities.org&lt;/code&gt; where I plan to analyze, build and evolve my identities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An identity section&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each identity may have the next sections. A simple heading with the name of the identity is just fine. You&#39;ll create the sections as long as you need them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis of the identity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here we can develop our thoughts on what does the identity mean and what do you see yourself embodying the identity&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity characteristics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;List the values, habits, abilities, knowledge, capabilities and experiences that define the identity, and analyse each of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is where we can sketch the plan we want to follow to grow or shrink this identity. It contains a list of &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/axis/&#34;&gt;identity axis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children identities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes an identity can be refined in smaller more specific identities, here we&#39;ll add sections for each of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dump your thoughts on your identities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before we get tainted with our past analysis imagine a fresh canvas and start painting yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can add a section in &lt;code&gt;think.org&lt;/code&gt; to record your findings. I found that I needed some time to do this dump, working on the section through days before the actual analysis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do an initial list of values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I first created a &lt;code&gt;global values or principles&lt;/code&gt; headline and listed all core principles such as:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;All creatures are beautiful&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Be excellent to each other&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Better done than perfect&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may refactor them into the identities once you start building them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do an initial list of identities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Empty your mind of the different identities that define you or that you want to be defined by. Create headlines for each using the sections defined above as you need them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do an initial list of axis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dream of what &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/axis/&#34;&gt;axis&lt;/a&gt; you&#39;ll want to address. If you can order them into identities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do the identity analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refactor the gathered thoughts into the &lt;code&gt;identities.org&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select the identities you want to prioritise in the year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Skim over all identities and for the ones you want to focus in the year:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;add the &lt;code&gt;identity&lt;/code&gt; tag&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;assign a priority&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;do not add a TODO keyword, we&#39;ll reserve them for the identity axis.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use the year custom agenda &lt;code&gt;identities&lt;/code&gt; section to adjust the priority of the different identities following the next guides:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Spread the identities over the different priorities so that each has more less the same number of elements.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Compare an identity with the ones that are above or below and decide if you promote or demote it&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If you don&#39;t want one identity to bien the list add the &lt;code&gt;backlog&lt;/code&gt; tag if you don&#39;t want that identity and it&#39;s subidentities to appear. Add the &lt;code&gt;hide&lt;/code&gt; tag in case you want any of the subidentities&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refine the identities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following the priority order of identities go one by one until you run out of time and:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Read the identity analysis and the different &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/axis/&#34;&gt;axis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Order the different axis by the impact they can have in the identity&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/axis/&#34;&gt;Refine the projects of each axis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;axis&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/axis/&#34;&gt;Axis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: Introduce the axis time navigation concept.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An identity axis is an abstract guide for action with an indefinite scope or a timeframe longer than one year.

Here are key best practices to help organizations right-size their Kubernetes deployments:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Availability Zone Consolidation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carefully evaluate the number of availability zones (AZs) used in your cluster. While multi-AZ deployments provide redundancy, using too many zones can: - Increase infrastructure complexity - Raise management overhead - Unnecessarily distribute resources - Increase cost without proportional benefit&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;: Aim for a balanced approach, typically 3 AZs, which provides robust redundancy while allowing more efficient resource consolidation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Intelligent Node Sizing and Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Implement sophisticated node management strategies:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Node Provisioning Optimization&lt;/strong&gt; - Use tools like Karpenter to dynamically manage node sizing - Continuously analyze and adjust node types based on actual workload requirements - Consolidate smaller nodes into fewer, more efficiently sized instances&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overhead Calculation&lt;/strong&gt; Regularly assess system and Kubernetes overhead: - Calculate total system resource consumption - Identify underutilized resources - Understand the overhead percentage for different node types - Make data-driven decisions about node scaling&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Advanced Pod Autoscaling Techniques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)&lt;/strong&gt; - Implement HPA for workloads with variable load - Automatically adjust pod count based on CPU/memory utilization - Ensure efficient resource distribution across existing nodes&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA)&lt;/strong&gt; - Use VPA in recommendation mode initially - Carefully evaluate automated resource adjustments - Manually apply recommendations to prevent potential service disruptions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Workload Optimization Strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Availability Considerations&lt;/strong&gt; - Ensure critical workloads have robust high availability configurations - Design applications to tolerate node failures gracefully - Implement pod disruption budgets to maintain service reliability&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource Right-Sizing&lt;/strong&gt; - Conduct thorough analysis of actual resource utilization - Avoid over-provisioning by matching resource requests to actual usage - Use monitoring tools to gain insights into workload characteristics&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Continuous Monitoring and Refinement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Implement comprehensive monitoring of cluster performance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Regularly review node utilization metrics&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create feedback loops for continuous optimization&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Develop scripts or use tools to collect and analyze resource usage data&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;continuous-deployment&#34;&gt;Continuous Deployment&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;argocd&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/argocd/&#34;&gt;ArgoCD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/argocd/#argocd-commandline-installation&#34;&gt;ArgoCD commandline installation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-sSL&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-o&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;argocd-linux-amd64&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/latest/download/argocd-linux-amd64

This command allows you to authenticate yourself, setting up a secure connection between your terminal and the Argo CD server. You’ll need to provide your server’s URL and your credentials. There are three different ways to login, I found that the &lt;code&gt;--core&lt;/code&gt; is the most useful as it will use your kubernetes credentials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;argocd&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;login&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;your.argocd.url.com&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--core&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--name&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;production
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be careful thought that you can&#39;t set different &lt;code&gt;argocd context&lt;/code&gt; for different clusters using the &lt;code&gt;--core&lt;/code&gt; even though &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/12883&#34;&gt;you set the &lt;code&gt;--kube-context&lt;/code&gt; flag&lt;/a&gt;. The config file &lt;code&gt;~/.config/argocd/config&lt;/code&gt; shows that it&#39;s using whatever kubernetes context you&#39;re using. So be careful that you&#39;re applying it in the correct one!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set an argocd context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;argocd context&lt;/code&gt; command is used to manage your Argo CD contexts. A context is a configuration that represents a Kubernetes cluster, user, and namespace. You can use this command to switch Argo CD between different contexts, allowing you to manage multiple Kubernetes namespaces and clusters from a single terminal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can see the different contexts with &lt;code&gt;argocd context&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get the list of applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;argocd&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;app&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;list

By configuring this setting, you allow Renovate to automerge PRs or even branches. Using automerge reduces the amount of human intervention required.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Usually you won&#39;t want to automerge all PRs, for example most people would want to leave major dependency updates to a human to review first. You could configure Renovate to automerge all but major this way:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&#34;matchUpdateTypes&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;minor&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;patch&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;pin&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;digest&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also note that this option can be combined with other nested settings, such as dependency type. So for example you could choose to automerge all (passing) devDependencies only this way:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&#34;automerge&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

You can put them in folders, on network devices and on your phones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Place them where nobody should be poking around and get a clear alarm if they are accessed. They are designed to look juicy to attackers to increase the likelihood that they are opened (and they are completely free).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our Canarytokens are easy to sprinkle all over and forget about, until you get the notification that matters. They are super lightweight and don’t require installing software or running more background processes that can slow down your PC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.canarytokens.org/guide/&#34;&gt;Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.canarytokens.org/nest/&#34;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt; feat(kubernetes#Move a pvc between AZ in aws): Move a pvc between AZ in aws&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-e

Así que verificar todo antes de tomarlo por verdad!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cuidado de personas mayores dependientes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;El cuidado de las personas mayores es una movida, especialmente cuando empiezan a ser dependientes. Normalmente necesitan cuidados la mayor parte del tiempo del día. Actualmente existen las siguientes opciones para impartir dichos cuidados:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;La red cercana (normalmente las mujeres de la familia) se encargan de dichos cuidados.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Parte o todos los cuidados se externalizan ya sea a una residencia de ancianos, centros de día o contratando a trabajadoras que acuden al hogar.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;En este mundo podrido donde los servicios públicos están siendo desmantelados, la oferta pública de centros de día o residencias es insuficiente y generalmente en manos de políticas incompetentes (nunca olvidemos &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elsaltodiario.com/residencias-mayores/7291-muertes-explicacion-familiares-residencias-denuncian-ayuso-sigue-bloqueando-verdad&#34;&gt;las 7291 muertes&lt;/a&gt; que pesan sobre los hombros de Ayuso &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@quietotodoelmundo&#34;&gt;{hija de puta!}&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Esto sumado a que las mujeres de la familia ahora trabajan y la precarización del sector de las empleadas del hogar hace que (sobre todo peña que tiene pasta) recurra a contratar trabajadoras en régimen de interna.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trabajo del hogar en régimen de interna&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;En realidad este trabajo es esclavismo encubierto bajo una pátina legal. Aprovechandose de que la profesión está feminizada y generalmente por personas migrantes, se imponen unas condiciones laborales que no cumplen el estatuto de las trabajadoras.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Con un salario que normalmente no supera el mínimo estas trabajadoras:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Trabajan muchas más horas que las 40 a la semana&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Hacen trabajos por fuera de su contrato como limpiar la casa o servir la comida.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Se encuentran encerradas en su lugar de trabajo. Incluso cuando &#34;dejan de trabajar&#34; están dentro del control de sus empleadores.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Al encontrarse solas con las personas a las que cuidan, 24 horas al día, es común encontrarse casos de violencia de género. Muchas cuentan testimonios de atrancar la puerta de su cuarto por la noche.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Los espacios que se les ceden (habitaciones o cuartos de baño) no se respetan y generalmente son usados por otras personas de la familia cuando lo desean, arrebatándoles incluso su cuarto propio.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Generalmente tienen unas dos horas al día para librar. Pero generalmente trabajan en barrios muy lejanos de su hogar, con precios y oferta de ocio muy lejana a sus posibilidades, así que normalmente usan esas horas para pasear. En invierno se pone más complicado con el frío y la lluvia.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Las que libran los fines de semana tienen que pagar una habitación o piso que sólo pueden disfrutar unos pocos días a la semana.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Tienen que soportar el maltrato y la tiranía propia de las personas mayores que ya empiezan a perder la cabeza. A esas edades se exacerban el clasismo y el racismo a la vez que desaparecen los mecanismos de control propio y filtro. Lo que genera situaciones muy desagradables que muchas veces desembocan en maltrato psicológico y físico.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Y aunque esto es harto conocido por la sociedad, es un modelo que se sigue usando con frecuencia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horario de trabajo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;En algunos casos las trabajadoras libran el fin de semana, 36 horas consecutivas según la ley, lo que podría ser de sábado a las 9:00 hasta el domingo a las 21:00, además de 2 horas al día (no remuneradas) en los días de entre semana. Esto hace un total de 122 horas trabajadas a la semana, mucho mayor de las 40 horas establecidas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Y aunque en teoría &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elsaltodiario.com/trabajo-domestico/justicia-europea-tira-orejas-espana-obliga-registrar-jornada-trabajadoras-del-hogar&#34;&gt;los empleadores están obligados a implementar un sistema para registrar la jornada de sus trabajadoras&lt;/a&gt; se torna &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elsaltodiario.com/trabajo-domestico/registrar-jornada-laboral-empleo-hogar&#34;&gt;difícil en la práctica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;La ley además establece que además de las 40 horas semanales se pueden tener 20 horas extras de presencia. Las horas de presencia se pagan a precio de hora normal porque el régimen de empleadas de hogar lo establece así. No es como otros convenios.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;La mayor parte de las trabajadoras no conoce que tienen derecho a estas 20 horas adicionales. Esas horas de presencia se pueden reclamar por los últimos 12 meses, las anteriores prescriben. Esto pueden ser unos 18.000 euros a reclamar. Para ello hacen falta pruebas de que la trabajadora está haciendo esa jornada. Una manera de pelearlo es pedir al empleador que justifique qué otras personas tiene contratadas para cuidar a la persona dependiente. Porque la prueba dentro de un domicilio es muy difícil. Si en el contrato no figura ningún horario se puede asumir que es 24h. También se puede preguntar a vecinos o si está empadronada.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lo que si es claro es que la empresa tiene que definir el horario de trabajo en el contrato, lo que no siempre hacen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pernocta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;En el contrato tiene que figurar si la trabajadora duerme en el lugar de trabajo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elsaltodiario.com/trabajo-domestico/registrar-jornada-laboral-empleo-hogar&#34;&gt;Es muy difícil de regular las veces que se despiertan en la noche, así que pelear eso es aún complicado.&lt;/a&gt; Aunque se van haciendo avances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Violencia y acoso en el empleo doméstico&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Según el &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2024-18182&#34;&gt;Real Decreto 893/2024&lt;/a&gt; a ojos de &lt;a href=&#34;https://noticias.juridicas.com/actualidad/noticias/19543-real-decreto-893-2024:-nuevos-derechos-laborales-para-las-empleadas-de-hogar-y-de-ayuda-a-domicilio-/&#34;&gt;noticias.juridicas.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;El abandono del domicilio ante una situación de violencia o acoso sufrida por la persona trabajadora no podrá considerarse dimisión ni podrá ser causa de despido, sin perjuicio de la posibilidad de la persona trabajadora de solicitar la extinción del contrato en virtud del artículo 50 ET y de la solicitud de medidas cautelares en caso de formulación de demandas, de conformidad con la LRJS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salario&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lo normal es que se pague el salario mínimo, aunque &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elsaltodiario.com/trabajo-domestico/empleadas-hogar-internas-trabajan-maximo-60-horas-semanales&#34;&gt;Cuatro de cada diez ni llegan a eso&lt;/a&gt;. Hay que tener en cuenta que el salario mínimo ha sido actualizado desde enero de 2025 a 1383 euros. Es probable que a muchas ni se lo suban.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Si se cuentan las 20 horas de presencia, el salario serían aproximadamente 2000 euros al mes (2094 según la &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sendadecuidados.org/cuidados-en-el-hogar/tablas-salariales/&#34;&gt;tabla salarial de senda de cuidados de 2024&lt;/a&gt; para un régimen de 6 noches a la semana).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pelear por sus derechos*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Normalmente aunque les cuentes todos los derechos que tienen, las trabajadoras no quieren reclamar ni ejercer sus derechos porque no se atreven. Por miedo a perder el trabajo u otras represalias.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Datos personales&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Las asesorías pueden sacar el número de la seguridad social con un nombre y un DNI. Esto se hace para facilitar los trámites. Pero si no lo sabes puede rayarte.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forma de pago&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;El empleador es el encargado de hacer la transferencia al trabajador como una nómina, no como una transferencia regular. Ya que si no el trabajador no obtiene las bonificaciones de tener domiciliada la nómina.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aunque haya agencias de por medio, estas generalmente hacen de intermediarias y sólo un trabajo de asesoría, por lo tanto el contrato se suele hacer con la familia de la persona que es cuidada, y esta es la que ha de hacer el ingreso a la trabajadora. A no ser que la agencia sea una ETT de empleadas del hogar, que en ese caso es la agencia la que las contrata directamente.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Denuncias de inspección de trabajo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Las denuncias de inspección de trabajo en este régimen tienen un recorrido diferente dependiendo de a qué inspector le toque, porque como inspección de trabajo no puede entrar en los domicilios particulares por sorpresa aunque sea una empresa. Entonces hay inspectores que las denuncias por maltrato de las empleadas del hogar las meten en el cajón. Otros no, requieren y de más.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impuestos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;En las nóminas de las empleadas del hogar no hay IRPF. Normalmente el salario y la prorrata se desglosa, si está junto es una nómina cutre.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Papeleos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Una vez firmado el contrato, la empresa ha de entregar a la trabajadora la huella digital de su contrato comunicado al servicio público de empleo. Cuando haces un alta de una trabajadora hay que mandar dos ficheros, uno a la tesorería general con el alta y otro al servicio público de empleo estatal con el contrato. Si no lo hacen es un defecto formal, no es gravísimo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Referencias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Empresas decentes: No todo es horrendo, existen cooperativas de trabajadoras que ofrecen estos servicios bajo unas condiciones que ellas han decidido:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sendadecuidados.org/&#34;&gt;Senda de cuidados&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lacomala.org/&#34;&gt;La Comala&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senda de cuidados publica su &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sendadecuidados.org/cuidados-en-el-hogar/tablas-salariales/&#34;&gt;tabla salarial&lt;/a&gt; en la que te puedes hacer una idea del salario y de los diferentes tipos de régimen de trabajo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mejoras legales&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2024-18182&#34;&gt;Real Decreto 893/2024, de 10 de septiembre, por el que se regula la protección de la seguridad y la salud en el ámbito del servicio del hogar familiar.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2022-14680&#34;&gt;Real Decreto-ley 16/2022, de 6 de septiembre, para la mejora de las condiciones de trabajo y de Seguridad Social de las personas trabajadoras al servicio del hogar.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artículos sobre el trabajo interno&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elsaltodiario.com/trabajo-domestico/empleadas-hogar-internas-trabajan-maximo-60-horas-semanales&#34;&gt; Trabajo doméstico Dos de cada tres empleadas del hogar internas trabajan más del máximo de 60 horas semanales &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elsaltodiario.com/trabajo-domestico/justicia-europea-tira-orejas-espana-obliga-registrar-jornada-trabajadoras-del-hogar&#34;&gt;La justicia europea tira de las orejas a España y obliga a registrar la jornada de las trabajadoras del hogar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elsaltodiario.com/trabajo-domestico/registrar-jornada-laboral-empleo-hogar&#34;&gt;Registrar la jornada laboral en el empleo de hogar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;conference-organisation&#34;&gt;Conference organisation&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;pretalx&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/pretalx/&#34;&gt;pretalx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/pretalx/#import-a-pretalx-calendar-in-giggity&#34;&gt;Import a pretalx calendar in giggity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Search the url similar to &lt;a href=&#34;https://pretalx.com/&#34;&gt;https://pretalx.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;conference-name&gt;/schedule/export/schedule.xml&lt;/conference-name&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 id=&#34;life-management&#34;&gt;Life Management&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;time-management&#34;&gt;Time management&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;org-mode&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/orgmode/&#34;&gt;Org Mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/orgmode/#footnotes&#34;&gt;Footnotes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A footnote is started by a footnote marker in square brackets in column 0, no indentation allowed.

&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can also define the &lt;code&gt;org_agenda_sorting_strategy&lt;/code&gt;. The default value is &lt;code&gt;{ agenda = {&#39;time-up&#39;, &#39;priority-down&#39;, &#39;category-keep&#39;}, todo = {&#39;priority-down&#39;, &#39;category-keep&#39;}, tags = {&#39;priority-down&#39;, &#39;category-keep&#39;}}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The available list of sorting strategies to apply to a given view are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;time-up&lt;/code&gt;: Sort entries by time of day. Applicable only in agenda view&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;time-down&lt;/code&gt;: Opposite of time-up&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;priority-down&lt;/code&gt;: Sort by priority, from highest to lowest&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;priority-up&lt;/code&gt;: Sort by priority, from lowest to highest&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tag-up&lt;/code&gt;: Sort by sorted tags string, ascending&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tag-down&lt;/code&gt;: Sort by sorted tags string, descending&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;todo-state-up&lt;/code&gt;: Sort by todo keyword by position (example: &#39;TODO, PROGRESS, DONE&#39; has a sort value of 1, 2 and 3), ascending&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;todo-state-down&lt;/code&gt;: Sort by todo keyword, descending&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;clocked-up&lt;/code&gt;: Show clocked in headlines first&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;clocked-down&lt;/code&gt;: Show clocked in headines last&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;category-up&lt;/code&gt;: Sort by category name, ascending&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;category-down&lt;/code&gt;: Sort by category name, descending&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;category-keep&lt;/code&gt;: Keep default category sorting, as it appears in org-agenda-files&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can open the custom agendas with the API too. For example to open the agenda stored under &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;     &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;gt&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;vim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;notify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;Opening today&#39;s agenda&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;vim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;levels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;INFO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;orgmode.api.agenda&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;open_by_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;t&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;desc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;Open orgmode agenda for today&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;In that case I&#39;m configuring the &lt;code&gt;keys&lt;/code&gt; section of the lazyvim plugin. Through the API you can also configure these options:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org_agenda_files&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org_agenda_sorting_strategy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org_agenda_category_filter_preset&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org_agenda_todo_ignore_deadlines&lt;/code&gt;: Ignore all deadlines that are too far in future (over org_deadline_warning_days). Possible values: all | near | far | past | future&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org_agenda_todo_ignore_scheduled&lt;/code&gt;: Ignore all headlines that are scheduled. Possible values: past | future | all&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/orgmode/#load-different-agendas-with-the-same-binding-depending-on-the-time&#34;&gt;Load different agendas with the same binding depending on the time.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I find it useful to bind &lt;code&gt;gt&lt;/code&gt; to Today&#39;s agenda, but what today means is different between week days. Imagine that you want to load an agenda if you&#39;re from monday to friday before 18:00 (a work agenda) versus a personal agenda the rest of the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You could then configure this function:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s the january&#39;s review and that you have two kinds of reviews, one personal and one for work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dump your mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first thing we want to do in the review is to dump all that&#39;s in our mind into our system to free up mental load.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try not to, but if you think of decisions you want to make that address the elements you&#39;re discovering, write them down in the &lt;code&gt;Decide&lt;/code&gt; section of your review document.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are different paths to discover actionable items:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Analyze what is in your mind: Take 10 minutes to answer to the questions of the template under the &#34;mental dump&#34; section (you don&#39;t need to answer them all). Notice that we do not need to review our life logging tools (diary, action manager, ...) to answer these questions. This means that we&#39;re doing an analysis of what is in our minds right now, not throughout the month. It&#39;s flawed but as we do this analysis often, it&#39;s probably fine. We add more importance to the latest events in our life anyway.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean your notebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Empty the elements you added to the &lt;code&gt;review box&lt;/code&gt;. I have them in my inbox with the tag &lt;code&gt;:review:&lt;/code&gt; (you have it in the month agenda view &lt;code&gt;gM&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Clean your life notebook by:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Iterate over the areas of &lt;code&gt;proyects.org&lt;/code&gt; only checking the first level of projects, don&#39;t go deeper and for each element:&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Move the done elements either to &lt;code&gt;archive.org&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;logbook.org&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Move to &lt;code&gt;backlog.org&lt;/code&gt; the elements that don&#39;t make sense to be active anymore&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Check if you have any &lt;code&gt;DONE&lt;/code&gt; element in &lt;code&gt;calendar.org&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Empty the &lt;code&gt;inbox.org&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Empty the &lt;code&gt;DONE&lt;/code&gt; elements of &lt;code&gt;talk.org&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clean the elements that don&#39;t make sense anymore from &lt;code&gt;think.org&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Process your &lt;code&gt;month checks&lt;/code&gt;. For each of them:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you need, add action elements in the &lt;code&gt;mental dump&lt;/code&gt; section of the review.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Think of whether you&#39;ve met the check.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refresh your idea of how the month go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Open your &lt;code&gt;bitácora.org&lt;/code&gt; agenda view to see what has been completed in the last month &lt;code&gt;match = &#39;CLOSED&amp;gt;&#34;&amp;lt;-30d&amp;gt;&#34;-work-steps-done&#39;,&lt;/code&gt; ordered by name &lt;code&gt;org_agenda_sorting_strategy = { &#34;category-keep&#34; },&lt;/code&gt; and change the priority of the elements according to the impact. Open your &lt;code&gt;recurrent.org&lt;/code&gt; agenda view to see what has been done the last month &lt;code&gt;match = &#39;LAST_REPEAT&amp;gt;&#34;&amp;lt;-30d&amp;gt;&#34;-work&#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Check what has been left of your month objectives &lt;code&gt;+m&lt;/code&gt; and refile the elements that don&#39;t make sense anymore.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Check the reports of your weekly reviews of the month in the &lt;code&gt;reviews.org&lt;/code&gt; document.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check your close compromises&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Check all your action management tools (in my case &lt;code&gt;orgmode&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ikhal&lt;/code&gt;) to identify: - Arranged compromises - trips&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/roadmap_adjustment/#life-roadmap-adjustment&#34;&gt;Life roadmap adjustment.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create next stage&#39;s life notebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After reading &#34;The Bulletproof Journal&#34;, I was drawn to the idea of changing notebooks each year, carrying over only the necessary things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I find this to be a powerful concept since you start each stage with a clean canvas. This brings you closer to desire versus duty as it removes the commitments you made to yourself, freeing up significant mental load. From this point, it&#39;s much easier to allow yourself to dream about what you want to do in this new stage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I want to apply this concept to my digital life notebook as I see the following advantages:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;It lightens my files making them easier to manage and faster to process with orgmode&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It&#39;s a very easy way to clean up&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It&#39;s an elegant way to preserve what you&#39;ve recorded without it becoming a hindrance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;In each stage, you can start with a different notebook structure, meaning new axes, tools, and structures. This helps avoid falling into the rigidity of a constrained system or artifacts defined by inertia rather than conscious decision&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It allows you to avoid maintaining files that follow an old scheme or having to migrate them to the new system&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Additionally, you get rid of all those actions you&#39;ve been reluctant to delete in one fell swoop&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The notebook change can be done in two phases:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Notebook Construction&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Stage Closure&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notebook Construction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This phase spans from when you start making stage adjustments until you finally close the current stage. You can follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create a directory with the name of the new stage. In my case, it&#39;s the number of my predominant age during the stage&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create a directory for the current stage&#39;s notebook within &#34;notebooks&#34; in your references. Here we&#39;ll move everything that doesn&#39;t make sense to maintain. It&#39;s important that this directory isn&#39;t within your agenda files&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Quickly review the improvements you&#39;ve noted that you want to implement in next year&#39;s notebook to keep them in mind. You can note the references in the &#34;Create new notebook&#34; action&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you review the stage, decide if it makes sense for the file you&#39;re viewing to exist as-is in the new notebook. Remember that the idea is to migrate minimal structure and data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;If it makes sense:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create a symbolic link in the new notebook. When closing the stage, we&#39;ll replace the link with the file&#39;s final state&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If the file no longer makes sense, move it to &lt;code&gt;references/notebooks&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;year-reviews&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/year_reviews/&#34;&gt;Year reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/year_reviews/#2025&#34;&gt;Cositas del 2025.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fascismo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;En el acto de toma de posesión del cargo de trump, elon musk hace el saludo nazi.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;elon nazi&#34; src=&#34;x.mp4&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feminismo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2025-01-20/trump-orders-reflect-his-promises-to-roll-back-transgender-protections-and-end-dei-programs&#34;&gt;trump nada más llegar al poder restablece el género de nacimiento a las personas trans y amenaza con terminar los programas de diversidad, inclusión e igualdad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;life-chores-management&#34;&gt;Life chores management&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;himalaya&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/himalaya/&#34;&gt;himalaya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/himalaya/#configure-gpg&#34;&gt;Configure GPG.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Himalaya relies on cargo features to enable gpg.

As of 2025-01-27 the &lt;code&gt;pgp-commands&lt;/code&gt; is enabled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You only need to add the next section to your config:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;pgp.type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&#34;commands&#34;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or you can combine this into a single command: &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;get&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pods&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-l&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;your-deployment-label&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-o&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;json&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;jq&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-r&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;.items[].spec.nodeName&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;xargs&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-I&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kubectl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;get&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;node&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-o&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;custom-columns&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;NAME:.metadata.name,ARCH:.status.nodeInfo.architecture
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can also check if your deployment is explicitly targeting specific architectures through node selectors or affinity rules: &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;get&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;deployment&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;your-deployment-name&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-o&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;yaml&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;grep&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-A&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;nodeSelector

Its primary function is to detect and report various indicators of drive reliability, or how long a drive can function while anticipating imminent hardware failures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When S.M.A.R.T. data indicates a possible imminent drive failure, software running on the host system may notify the user so action can be taken to prevent data loss, and the failing drive can be replaced and no data is lost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Monitoring,_Analysis_and_Reporting_Technology#Accuracy&#34;&gt;Accuracy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A field study at Google covering over 100,000 consumer-grade drives from December 2005 to August 2006 found correlations between certain S.M.A.R.T. information and annualized failure rates:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;In the 60 days following the first uncorrectable error on a drive (S.M.A.R.T. attribute 0xC6 or 198) detected as a result of an offline scan, the drive was, on average, 39 times more likely to fail than a similar drive for which no such error occurred.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;First errors in reallocations, offline reallocations (S.M.A.R.T. attributes 0xC4 and 0x05 or 196 and 5) and probational counts (S.M.A.R.T. attribute 0xC5 or 197) were also strongly correlated to higher probabilities of failure.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Conversely, little correlation was found for increased temperature and no correlation for usage level. However, the research showed that a large proportion (56%) of the failed drives failed without recording any count in the &#34;four strong S.M.A.R.T. warnings&#34; identified as scan errors, reallocation count, offline reallocation, and probational count.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Further, 36% of failed drives did so without recording any S.M.A.R.T. error at all, except the temperature, meaning that S.M.A.R.T. data alone was of limited usefulness in anticipating failures.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.shadypixel.com/monitoring-hard-drive-health-on-linux-with-smartmontools/&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Debian systems:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;apt-get&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;smartmontools
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;By default when you install it all your drives are checked periodically with the &lt;code&gt;smartd&lt;/code&gt; daemon under the &lt;code&gt;smartmontools&lt;/code&gt; systemd service.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running the tests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Monitoring,_Analysis_and_Reporting_Technology#Self-tests&#34;&gt;Test types&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;S.M.A.R.T. drives may offer a number of self-tests:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Short: Checks the electrical and mechanical performance as well as the read performance of the disk. Electrical tests might include a test of buffer RAM, a read/write circuitry test, or a test of the read/write head elements. Mechanical test includes seeking and servo on data tracks. Scans small parts of the drive&#39;s surface (area is vendor-specific and there is a time limit on the test). Checks the list of pending sectors that may have read errors, and it usually takes under two minutes.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Long/extended: A longer and more thorough version of the short self-test, scanning the entire disk surface with no time limit. This test usually takes several hours, depending on the read/write speed of the drive and its size. It is possible for the long test to pass even if the short test fails.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Conveyance: Intended as a quick test to identify damage incurred during transporting of the device from the drive manufacturer to the computer manufacturer. Only available on ATA drives, and it usually takes several minutes.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drives remain operable during self-test, unless a &#34;captive&#34; option (ATA only) is requested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Start with a long self test with &lt;code&gt;smartctl&lt;/code&gt;. Assuming the disk to test is &lt;code&gt;/dev/sdd&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;smartctl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-t&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;long&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/dev/sdd
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The command will respond with an estimate of how long it thinks the test will take to complete.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To check progress use:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;martctl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-A&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/dev/sdd&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;grep&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;remaining
smartctl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-c&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/dev/sdd&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;grep&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;remaining
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t check too often because it can abort the test with some drives. If you receive an empty output, examine the reported status with:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;`bash smartctl -l selftest /dev/sdd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If errors are shown, check the &lt;code&gt;dmesg&lt;/code&gt; as there are usually useful traces of the error.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/smartctl/#understanding-the-tests&#34;&gt;Understanding the tests.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The output of a &lt;code&gt;smartctl&lt;/code&gt; command is difficult to read:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;smartctl 5.40 2010-03-16 r3077 [x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu] (local build)

SMART overall-health self-assessment test result: PASSED
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;If it doesn’t return PASSED, you should immediately backup all your data. Your hard drive is probably failing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That message can also be shown with &lt;code&gt;smartctl -H /dev/sda&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Monitoring,_Analysis_and_Reporting_Technology#Known_ATA_S.M.A.R.T._attributes&#34;&gt;Checking the SMART attributes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each drive manufacturer defines a set of attributes, and sets threshold values beyond which attributes should not pass under normal operation. But they do not agree on precise attribute definitions and measurement units, the following list of attributes is a general guide only.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If one or more attribute have the &#34;prefailure&#34; flag, and the &#34;current value&#34; of such prefailure attribute is smaller than or equal to its &#34;threshold value&#34; (unless the &#34;threshold value&#34; is 0), that will be reported as a &#34;drive failure&#34;. In addition, a utility software can send SMART RETURN STATUS command to the ATA drive, it may report three status: &#34;drive OK&#34;, &#34;drive warning&#34; or &#34;drive failure&#34;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ma.juii.net/blog/interpret-smart-attributes&#34;&gt;SMART attributes columns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every of the SMART attributes has several columns as shown by “smartctl -a &lt;device&gt;”:&lt;/device&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;ID: The ID number of the attribute, good for comparing with other lists like &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Monitoring,_Analysis_and_Reporting_Technology#Known_ATA_S.M.A.R.T._attributes&#34;&gt;Wikipedia: S.M.A.R.T.: Known ATA S.M.A.R.T. attributes&lt;/a&gt; because the attribute names sometimes differ. Name: The name of the SMART attribute.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Value: The current, normalized value of the attribute. Higher values are always better (except for temperature for hard disks of some manufacturers). The range is normally 0-100, for some attributes 0-255 (so that 100 resp. 255 is best, 0 is worst). There is no standard on how manufacturers convert their raw value to this normalized one: when the normalized value approaches threshold, it can do linearily, exponentially, logarithmically or any other way, meaning that a doubled normalized value does not necessarily mean “twice as good”.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Worst: The worst (normalized) value that this attribute had at any point of time where SMART was enabled. There seems to be no mechanism to reset current SMART attribute values, but this still makes sense as some SMART attributes, for some manufacturers, fluctuate over time so that keeping the worst one ever is meaningful.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Threshold: The threshold below which the normalized value will be considered “exceeding specifications”. If the attribute type is “Pre-fail”, this means that SMART thinks the hard disk is just before failure. This will “trigger” SMART: setting it from “SMART test passed” to “SMART impending failure” or similar status.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Type: The type of the attribute. Either “Pre-fail” for attributes that are said to indicate impending failure, or “Old_age” for attributes that just indicate wear and tear. Note that one and the same attribute can be classified as “Pre-fail” by one manufacturer or for one model and as “Old_age” by another or for another model. This is the case for example for attribute Seek_Error_Rate (ID 7), which is a widespread phenomenon on many disks and not considered critical by some manufacturers, but Seagate has it as “Pre-fail”.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Raw value: The current raw value that was converted to the normalized value above. smartctl shows all as decimal values, but some attribute values of some manufacturers cannot be reasonably interpreted that way&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/smartctl/#reacting-to-smart-values&#34;&gt;Reacting to SMART Values.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is said that a drive that starts getting bad sectors (attribute ID 5) or “pending” bad sectors (attribute ID 197; they most likely are bad, too) will usually be trash in 6 months or less. The only exception would be if this does not happen: that is, bad sector count increases, but then stays stable for a long time, like a year or more. For that reason, one normally needs a diagramming / journaling tool for SMART. Many admins will exchange the hard drive if it gets reallocated sectors (ID 5) or sectors “under investigation” (ID 197)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Monitoring,_Analysis_and_Reporting_Technology#Known_ATA_S.M.A.R.T._attributes&#34;&gt;Critical SMART attributes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of all the attributes I&#39;m going to analyse only the critical ones&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read Error Rate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ID: 01 (0x01) deal: Low +Correlation with probability of failure: not clear&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Vendor specific raw value.) Stores data related to the rate of hardware read errors that occurred when reading data from a disk surface. The raw value has different structure for different vendors and is often not meaningful as a decimal number. For some drives, this number may increase during normal operation without necessarily signifying errors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reallocated Sectors Count&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ID: 05 (0x05) Ideal: Low Correlation with probability of failure: Strong&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Count of reallocated sectors. The raw value represents a count of the bad sectors that have been found and remapped. Thus, the higher the attribute value, the more sectors the drive has had to reallocate. This value is primarily used as a metric of the life expectancy of the drive; a drive which has had any reallocations at all is significantly more likely to fail in the immediate months. If Raw value of 0x05 attribute is higher than its Threshold value, that will reported as &#34;drive warning&#34;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spin Retry Count&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ID: 10 (0x0A) Ideal: Low Correlation with probability of failure: Strong&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Count of retry of spin start attempts. This attribute stores a total count of the spin start attempts to reach the fully operational speed (under the condition that the first attempt was unsuccessful). An increase of this attribute value is a sign of problems in the hard disk mechanical subsystem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Pending Sector Count&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ID: 197 (0xC5) Ideal: Low Correlation with probability of failure: Strong&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Count of &#34;unstable&#34; sectors (waiting to be remapped, because of unrecoverable read errors). If an unstable sector is subsequently read successfully, the sector is remapped and this value is decreased. Read errors on a sector will not remap the sector immediately (since the correct value cannot be read and so the value to remap is not known, and also it might become readable later); instead, the drive firmware remembers that the sector needs to be remapped, and will remap it the next time it has been successfully read.[76]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, some drives will not immediately remap such sectors when successfully read; instead the drive will first attempt to write to the problem sector, and if the write operation is successful the sector will then be marked as good (in this case, the &#34;Reallocation Event Count&#34; (0xC4) will not be increased). This is a serious shortcoming, for if such a drive contains marginal sectors that consistently fail only after some time has passed following a successful write operation, then the drive will never remap these problem sectors. If Raw value of 0xC5 attribute is higher than its Threshold value, that will reported as &#34;drive warning&#34;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Offline) Uncorrectable Sector Count&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ID: 198 (0xC6) Ideal: Low Correlation with probability of failure: Strong&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The total count of uncorrectable errors when reading/writing a sector. A rise in the value of this attribute indicates defects of the disk surface and/or problems in the mechanical subsystem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the 60 days following the first uncorrectable error on a drive (S.M.A.R.T. attribute 0xC6 or 198) detected as a result of an offline scan, the drive was, on average, 39 times more likely to fail than a similar drive for which no such error occurred.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non critical SMART attributes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next attributes appear to change in the logs but that doesn&#39;t mean that there is anything going wrong&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware ECC Recovered&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ID: 195 (0xC3) Ideal: Varies Correlation with probability of failure: Low&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Vendor-specific raw value.) The raw value has different structure for different vendors and is often not meaningful as a decimal number. For some drives, this number may increase during normal operation without necessarily signifying errors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/smartctl/#monitorization&#34;&gt;Monitorization.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To monitor your drive health you can use &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/devops/prometheus/prometheus/&#34;&gt;prometheus&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/devops/prometheus/alertmanager/&#34;&gt;alertmanager&lt;/a&gt; for alerts and &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/grafana/&#34;&gt;grafana&lt;/a&gt; for dashboards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installing the exporter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The prometheus community has it&#39;s own &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/prometheus-community/smartctl_exporter&#34;&gt;smartctl exporter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the binary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can download the latest binary from the repository &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/prometheus-community/smartctl_exporter/releases&#34;&gt;releases&lt;/a&gt; and configure the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/prometheus-community/smartctl_exporter/blob/master/systemd/smartctl_exporter.service&#34;&gt;systemd service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;unp&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;smartctl_exporter-0.13.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

In my case, I faced a decision point with my storage cluster: after two years of reliable service from my 8TB drives, I needed more capacity. This led me to investigate the best way to integrate newly acquired refurbished 12TB drives into the system. Here&#39;s my journey through this decision-making process and the insights gained along the way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Starting Point&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My existing setup consisted of 8TB drives purchased new, which had been running smoothly for two years. The need for expansion led me to consider refurbished 12TB drives as a cost-effective solution. However, mixing new and refurbished drives, especially of different capacities, raised several important considerations that needed careful analysis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial Drive Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first step was to evaluate the reliability of all drives. Using &lt;code&gt;smartctl&lt;/code&gt;, I analyzed the SMART data across both the existing and new drives:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;disk&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;a&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;c&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;d&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;f&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;g&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;h&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;/dev/sd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$disk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;: old &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;smartctl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-a&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/dev/sd&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$disk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;grep&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Old&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;wc&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-l&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt; pre-fail: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;smartctl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-a&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/dev/sd&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$disk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;grep&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Pre-&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;wc&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-l&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results showed similar values across all drives, with &#34;Old_Age&#34; attributes ranging from 14-17 and &#34;Pre-fail&#34; attributes between 3-6. While this indicated all drives were aging, they were still functioning with acceptable parameters. However, raw SMART data doesn&#39;t tell the whole story, especially when comparing new versus refurbished drives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive Reliability Considerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After careful evaluation, I found myself trusting the existing 8TB drives more than the newer refurbished 12TB ones. This conclusion was based on several factors:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The 8TB drives had a proven track record in my specific environment&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Their smaller size meant faster resilver times, reducing the window of vulnerability during recovery&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;One of the refurbished 12TB drives was already showing concerning symptoms (8 reallocated sectors, although a badblocks didn&#39;t increase that number), which reduced confidence in the entire batch&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The existing drives were purchased new, while the 12TB drives were refurbished, adding an extra layer of uncertainty&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layout Options Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When expanding a ZFS system, there&#39;s always the temptation to simply add more vdevs to the existing pool. However, I investigated two main approaches:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Creating a new separate ZFS pool with the new disks&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Add another vdev to the existent pool&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resilver time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adding the 12TB drives to the pool and redistributing the data across all 8 drives will help reduce the resilver time. Here&#39;s a detailed breakdown:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Situation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;4x 8TB drives at 95% capacity means each drive is heavily packed&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;High data density means longer resilver times&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Limited free space for data movement and reconstruction&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After Adding 12TB Drives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Total pool capacity increases significantly&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ZFS will automatically start rebalancing data across all 8 drives&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;This process (sometimes called &#34;data shuffling&#34; or &#34;data redistribution&#34;) has several benefits:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reduces data density per drive&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Creates more free space&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Improves overall pool performance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Potentially reduces future resilver times&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resilver Time Reduction Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;With data spread across more drives, each individual drive has less data to resilver&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Less data per drive = faster resilver process&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The redistribution happens gradually and in the background&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Failure Scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The key differentiator between these approaches came down to failure scenarios:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Drive Failure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both configurations handle single drive failures similarly, though the 12TB drives&#39; longer resilver time creates a longer window of vulnerability in the two-vdev configuration if the data load is evenly shared between the disks. This is particularly concerning with refurbished drives, where the failure probability might be higher.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However if as soon as you add the other vdev to the pool you defragment the data inside zfs, the 8TB drives will be less filled, so until more data is added you may reduce the resilver time as they have less data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double Drive Failure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is where the configurations differ significantly:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;In a two-vdev pool, losing two drives from the same vdev would cause complete pool failure&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;With separate pools, a double drive failure would only affect one pool, allowing the other to continue operating. This way you can store the critical data on the pool you trust more.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Given the mixed drive origins (new vs refurbished), isolating potential failures becomes more critical&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance Considerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While investigating performance implications, I found several interesting points about IOPS and throughput:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;ZFS stripes data across vdevs, meaning more vdevs generally means better IOPS&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;In RAIDZ configurations, IOPS are limited by the slowest drive in the vdev&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Multiple mirrored vdevs provide the best combined IOPS performance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Streaming speeds scale with the number of data disks in a RAIDZ vdev&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;When mixing drive sizes, ZFS tends to favor larger vdevs, which could lead to uneven wear&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easiness of configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cache and log&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you already have a zpool with a cache and logs in nvme, then if you were to use two pools, you&#39;d need to reformat your nvme drives to create space for the new partitions needed for the new zpool.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This would allow you to specify different cache sizes for each pool. But it comes at the cost of a more complex operation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New pool creation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adding a vdev to an existing pool is quicker and easier than to create a zpool. You need to make sure that you initialise it with the correct configuration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having two pools doubles the operation tasks. One of the pools are to be filled soon, so you may need to manually move files and directories around to rebalance it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Decision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After weighing all factors, if you favour reliability over easiness of your life implement two separate ZFS pools. This statement is primarily driven by:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Reliability&lt;/strong&gt;: By separating the pools, we can maintain service availability even if one pool fails completely&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Prioritization&lt;/strong&gt;: This allows placing critical application data on the more reliable pool (8TB drives), while using the refurbished drives for less critical data like media files&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Isolation&lt;/strong&gt;: Keeping the proven, new-purchased drives separate from the refurbished ones minimizes the impact of potential issues with the refurbished drives&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistent Performance&lt;/strong&gt;: Following the best practice of keeping same-sized drives together in pools&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;However I&#39;m currently favouring easiness of life and trust my backup solution (I hope not to read this line in the future with regret :P), so I&#39;ll go with two vdevs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Through this investigation, I learned several important lessons about ZFS storage design:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Raw parity drive count isn&#39;t the only reliability metric - configuration matters more than simple redundancy numbers&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pool layout significantly impacts both performance and failure scenarios&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sometimes simpler configurations (like separate pools) can provide better overall reliability than more complex ones&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Consider the full lifecycle of the storage, including maintenance operations like resilver times&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;When expanding storage, don&#39;t underestimate the value of isolating different generations or sources of hardware&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The history and source of drives (new vs refurbished) should influence your pool design decisions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;This investigation reinforced that storage design isn&#39;t just about maximizing space or performance - it&#39;s about finding the right balance of reliability, performance, and manageability for your specific needs.

Their goal is to make Congress more inclusive by supporting those who might not usually attend, including people with special needs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/ccc/#first-time-angel-tips&#34;&gt;First time angel tips.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re lost on what shifts you might want to take here is the ones I&#39;ve found easy to do: - Talk access shifts: You will be on the access of the talks making sure that the doors are opened and closed when it should and that people do not linger in the corridors, whenever you want to see a talk in one of the main tracks take these shifts as you&#39;ll be able to watch it fine and also help the organisation. If you know for sure you&#39;ll be attending one of these talks, reserve the shift the day before as they usually fly away soon. - Standby angel: You just stay in heaven for a couple of hours waiting for someone to tell you what you need to do. It&#39;s a good shift to know people and to find your place in heaven. If you know for sure you&#39;ll have a free slot between talks and workshops, reserve the shift the day before as they usually fly away soon. - At teardown: If you can stay after the congress has ended, help in the tear down, I first go to the assemblies that have attracted me the most and then go to heaven to see what else is needed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;anarchism&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/anarchism/&#34;&gt;Anarchism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/anarchism/#anarchism-in-belarus&#34;&gt;Anarchism in Belarus.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://abc-belarus.org/en/main-page/&#34;&gt;Anarchist black cross Belarus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bsky.app/profile/bad-immigrant.bsky.social&#34;&gt;Bad immigrant bluesky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pramen.io/en/&#34;&gt;Pramen website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kolektiva.media/c/pramenby/videos?s=1&#34;&gt;Pramen videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 id=&#34;life-management&#34;&gt;Life Management&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;time-management&#34;&gt;Time management&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;roadmap-adjustment&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/roadmap_adjustment/&#34;&gt;Roadmap Adjustment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: Small annotations throughout the document.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea of each adjustment is that it&#39;s not cumbersome, so I&#39;ve decided to set a fixed time for each one, I assume that I&#39;ll do my best on both processes and wherever I reach is just fine (remember, better done than perfect).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe on the power of constant small changes, so the next review will be built on top of the current one, and thus it will be done better and faster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/roadmap_adjustment/#year-review&#34;&gt;Do the first sketch of the year review.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the year comes to an end it can be a good idea to review stuff that has a year cadence of change and that people are reviewing, for example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#how-the-world-has-changed&#34;&gt;How the world has changed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Relevant content stuff&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Life experiences&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Your toolset&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Your economical year review&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not going to review the year roadmap or how I&#39;ve changed or my tactics or strategies right now as I feel it makes more sense to do it in the &lt;a href=&#34;#life-review&#34;&gt;life review&lt;/a&gt; just before spring comes. In fact, we&#39;ll be able to do a better life review once we have the output of the review of the year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year review timeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you can see the amount of stuff to review is not something that can be done in a day, my current plan is to prepare the review of the year throughout December and carry it out on the first two weeks of January.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I&#39;ve scheduled an action each 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of December with deadline on the 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create a new entry in &lt;code&gt;think.org&lt;/code&gt; with the next format: &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then I created another action from the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of January to the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; to actually do the review.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year review phases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the world has changed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You don&#39;t live alone in a bubble, your life is affected by what is going on around you, so if you can it&#39;s always good to analyse it so that you can adjust your roadmap accordingly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doing this on January makes a lot of sense because most newspapers and important people do a year review which synthesizes the most important year events and how it has changed throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&#39;m usually gathering the analysis on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/year_reviews/&#34;&gt;Year reviews&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did my economy change this year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I take the chance to do a last review of the year through the lenses of my accounting system (&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/beancount/&#34;&gt;beancount&lt;/a&gt;). I&#39;ve made some fava dashboards that gather the most interesting information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review the relevant content I&#39;ve consumed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the use of &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/mediatracker/&#34;&gt;mediatracker&lt;/a&gt; and other life logging tools I take a look at what content I&#39;ve enjoyed the most. I want to share it also with all of you through these articles:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/books/&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;movies.md&#34;&gt;Movies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;tv_shows.md&#34;&gt;TV shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/podcasts/&#34;&gt;Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;streaming_channels.md&#34;&gt;Streaming channels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;music.md&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;videogames.md&#34;&gt;Videogames&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;boardgames.md&#34;&gt;Boardgames&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/roadmap_adjustment/#life-review&#34;&gt;First sketch of the life review.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Life reviews are meant to give you an idea of:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;How much have you and your workflows evolved&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;What roadmap decisions were right, which ones were wrong&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;With the context you have now, you can think of how you could have avoided the bad decisions.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have the year&#39;s planning you can analyze it against your task management tools and life logs and create a review document analyzing all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life review timeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you can see the amount of stuff to review is not something that can be done in a day, my current plan is to prepare the review from the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of December till the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of January and then carry it out until the 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of February, to leave space to do the spring quarter and March month reviews.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;year-reviews&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/year_reviews/&#34;&gt;Year reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: Primera versión de la revisión del 2024.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fuentes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elsaltodiario.com/boletin/balance-2024-socias&#34;&gt;Boletín de socias de El Salto 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elsaltodiario.com/fotografia/imagenes-un-ano-no-se-pudo-parar-genocidio&#34;&gt;Fotografías de un año en el que no se pudo parar el genocidio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elsaltodiario.com/boletin/diciembre-2024&#34;&gt;Boletín de diciembre de El Salto 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elsaltodiario.com/feminismos/siete-palabras-entender-feminismos-2024&#34;&gt;Siete palabras para entender feminismos 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fascismo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;En 2024, a nivel estatal la extrema derecha avanzó posiciones y cuotas de poder, pero las movilizaciones masivas por la vivienda, contra el modelo turístico y la gestión de la dana desafiaron abiertamente su relato del mundo y su reparto de culpas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A nivel mundial la cosa va incluso peor:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;estados unidos, la principal potencia económica y militar del mundo ha vuelto a caer en manos de Trump, un multimillonario sádico, que ha conseguido todo su poder a través de su gigantesco poder mediático y un ejército de trolls, bulos y paramilitares supremacistas vestidos con pasamontañas y fusiles de asalto. Los principales países del mundo ya han caído o están a punto de caer en las redes de esta internacional de la desinformación, respaldada y promocionada a su vez por cuatro de los cinco hombres más ricos del mundo.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Uno de ellos es elon musk, un ser despreciable que tras cargarse twitter está haciendo campaña por las ultraderechas como la alemana afd. - &lt;a href=&#34;https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidencia_de_Javier_Milei&#34;&gt;en argentina ha estado gobernando javier milei&lt;/a&gt; desde el 10 de diciembre de 2023, básicamente se está cargando el estado de derecho y todos los avances en políticas feministas que se consiguieron con tanto esfuerzo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antifascismo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Las resistencias a las ideas que propugna esta coalición mundial neofascista, que culpa a la migración y a los pobres de todos los males, que niega el cambio climático, los derechos LGTBIQ+ y de las mujeres, pasan por otro lado.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Desde El Salto tenemos la convicción de que el resultado de esta contienda se dirimirá en gran parte en el campo de la información, de los medios y las redes sociales. Por eso creemos que es tan importante, ahora más que nunca, contar con medios propios, que no dependan de grandes poderes económicos o intereses partidarios.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Byron Maher&#34; src=&#34;../../img/2024-antifa.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Manifestación antiracista en las calles de Londres.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vivienda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Las gigantescas movilizaciones por la vivienda y contra el modelo depredador del turismo que recorrieron 2024 desde las Islas Canarias, pasando por Baleares, Madrid, Barcelona y casi todas las grandes capitales españolas, son una buena demostración de que el final de esta película está abierto. Después de estas demostraciones de fuerza y significado, la vivienda no es más barata, pero son menos las personas que piensan que el problema de fondo son los “inquiokupas”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Luz Sosa&#34; src=&#34;../../img/2024-vivienda.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Canarias se plantó en el mes de abril ante el turismo de masas en una movilización histórica simultánea en las ocho islas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Álvaro Minguito&#34; src=&#34;../../img/2024-vivienda-1.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Manifestación contra la especulación inmobiliaria y por el derecho a la vivienda en octubre.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Alberto Astudillo&#34; src=&#34;../../img/2024-vivienda-2.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Los desahucios han continuado durante el 2024, al amparo de la cobertura jurídica ofrecida a los especuladores que trafican con el derecho a la vivienda digna, en contra de lo que establece la Constitución Española.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Álvaro Minguito&#34; src=&#34;../../img/2024-vivienda-3.jpg&#34;/&gt; Un amanecer en el barrio de Lavapiés, mientras el vecindario espera un nuevo desahucio en su calle, que finalmente se ejecutó, dejando a otra familia en la calle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cambio climático&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;La Dana&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similar lucha por el discurso y reparto de culpas se produjo tras la dana en València, donde los intentos de la ultraderecha de dirigir el debate hacia los saqueos realizados supuestamente por migrantes fueron frustrados por la emocionante respuesta popular para hacer llegar una ayuda que ninguna institución, ni local ni estatal, estaba proporcionando.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Jaime Pérez Rivero&#34; src=&#34;../../img/2025-01-05-dana.jpg&#34;/&gt; Una senyera del Pais Valencià en una ventana de Paiporta, tras el paso de la dana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Pedro Armestre&#34; src=&#34;../../img/2024-dana-2.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;El cuerpo de un perro flota junto a los restos de cañizo y arboles arrastrados por la Dana a la playa de Pinedo. La pérdida de biodiversidad, víctima y a la vez solución de esta crisis, también está detrás de lo que está ocurriendo. Restaurar la naturaleza es clave para protegernos frente a eventos extremos a la vez que es una oportunidad transformadora para tener unos entornos resilientes y sanos para la biodiversidad y las personas. Para esto se necesitan medidas desde el nivel local hasta el global.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Jose Ángel Sánchez Rocamora&#34; src=&#34;../../img/2024-dana-3.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No obstante la población valenciana (y la del resto del estado) ha hecho ver el descontento con la mala gestión que hizo el gobierno del PP en la comunidad como se puede ver en la manifestación multitudinaria del 30 de noviembre para pedir la dimisión del president Carlos Mazón.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feminismo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Este 2024 también ha estado marcado por las luchas feministas: el terremoto mediático y social provocado por las denuncias anónimas de violencia sexual en redes ha trastocado el panorama político, ha revuelto el mundo del cine y del teatro, y sobre todo, ha resquebrajado el armazón de impunidad que recubre las agresiones machistas. Más allá de dónde acabe todo esto, el movimiento feminista ha vuelto a demostrar su enorme potencia de cambio en un sentido opuesto a la agenda de la extrema derecha.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Elisa González&#34; src=&#34;../../img/2024-feminismo.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;El 25 de noviembre, Día Internacional de la Eliminación de la Violencia contra la Mujer, se celebró en medio de una intensa conversación en torno a las violencias sexuales.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caso Pelicot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Martin Barzilai&#34; src=&#34;../../img/2025-01-05-dana.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;El 19 de diciembre de 2024 conocimos la sentencia del caso Pelicot. Dominique fue condenado a 20 años, la pena máxima. El Tribunal de Aviñón (Francia) que lo juzgaba lo consideró culpable de un delito de violación agravada contra ahora ya exesposa Gisèle Pelicot. Desde julio de 2011 y hasta octubre de 2020, el hombre utilizó webs de citas para invitar a desconocidos a agredir sexualmente a su entonces esposa, a la que previamente había suministrado una cantidad de ansiolíticos suficiente como para acercarla “al estado de coma”. Los otros casi cincuenta acusados han sido declarados culpables de violación con penas de entre tres y 15 años.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gisèle también ha hecho alusión a la vergüenza cuando ha explicado por qué todo el mundo la conoce por el apellido de su exmarido y agresor: “Tengo nietos y no quiero que se avergüencen de usar ese apellido. Quiero que estén orgullosos de su abuela. A partir de hoy se recordará a la señora Pelicot y cada vez menos al señor Pelicot”, explicó esta mujer que aunque ha recuperado su apellido tras divorciarse no quiere regalarle el nombre de sus nietos a un violador.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;La consigna “la vergüenza debe cambiar de bando” se ha repetido más allá de Francia y tuvo un lugar destacado en las convocatorias del 25 de noviembre, Día por la Eliminación de la Violencia contra las Mujeres.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caso Errejón&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;El 23 de octubre, el testimonio de una mujer, publicado en la cuenta de la periodista Cristina Fallarás en Instagram corre por las redes. La mujer señala a “un político de Madrid” como un “maltratador psicológico”. En pocas horas, las redes identifican a Íñigo Errejón. El jueves 25 de octubre, Errejón anuncia que abandona la política y esa misma tarde la actriz Elisa Mouliaá presenta una denuncia ante la Policía en la que relata una agresión sexual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Migración&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;El fin de año además nos arroja otra cifra, no por esperada menos demoledora: la estimación de más de diez mil personas muertas tratando de llegar a nuestro país. Personas que, por mucho que se empeñe una extrema derecha en auge mediático, solo buscaban mejorar en algo sus vidas y que la perdieron por un sistema cruel que denomina a este otro genocidio “crisis migratoria”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Manuel del Valle&#34; src=&#34;../../img/2024-migracion.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Las fronteras españolas han marcado este 2024 un récord de la vergüenza: 10.457 personas han muerto tratando de alcanzar las costas de la península.

La cosa no ha ido a mejor en estos 12 meses y a este genocidio calculado le han acompañado otras desgracias, como la creciente crisis ambiental con efectos cada vez más recurrentes en todo el planeta, incluida nuestra españita. En Valencia 231 personas han perdido la vida y 4 más permanecen desaparecidas a causa de una dana que arrasó en pocas horas la comunidad, muertes que quizá pudieron haberse evitado si los responsables políticos hubieran actuado con algo de los que se les presupone, vocación de servicio público, en vez de esconder sus miserias y tratar a toda costa judicial de evitar responsabilidades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tras la elección de trump el panorama de palestina no ha hecho más que empeorar (aunque harris tampoco tenía pinta que se fuese a mojar lo más mínimo).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No obstante la sociedad está respondiendo como buenamente puede para presionar a sus gobiernos a que paren el genocidio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Montecruz foto&#34; src=&#34;../../img/2025-01-05-gaza.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;En el mes de mayo, cientos de estudiantes tomaron la Universidad Humboldt de Berlín en apoyo a Gaza.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Dani Gago&#34; src=&#34;../../img/2024-palestina.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;La batalla naval de Vallecas en 2024, con especial recuerdo para Palestina.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Siria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Laurent Perpigna Iban&#34; src=&#34;../../img/2024-siria.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Miembros árabes de las Fuerzas Democráticas Sirias en el interior del estadio de Rakka, que el Estado Islámico había convertido en prisión. &lt;strong&gt;Honduras&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Edu León&#34; src=&#34;../../img/2024-honduras.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Honduras heredó del narcogobierno de Juan Orlando Hernández la violencia que ejercen de forma estructural la Policía, el Ejército, las maras y los sicarios contratados por las empresas para matar a líderes ambientales. &lt;strong&gt;Corrupción&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;República&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Este año la monarquía ha caído algo en el ideario popular, aunque no lo suficiente.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Sou Harris&#34; src=&#34;../../img/2024-republica.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Momentos de tensión en la visita de los reyes y representantes políticos 5 días después del paso de la Dana en Valencia.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;print(parse_slides..&lt;/code&gt; part it&#39;s temporal code so that you can debug your code easily. Once it&#39;s ready you&#39;ll remove them&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call a method of a module&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To run the method of a module:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;local&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;setup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;-- nothing yet&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can do &lt;code&gt;require(&#39;org-misc&#39;).setup()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set keymaps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside the code of the plugin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can set keymaps into your plugins by using:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;vim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;keymap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;n&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;n&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem is that it will override the &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; key everywhere which is not a good idea, that&#39;s why we normally limit it to the current buffer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can get the current buffer with &lt;code&gt;buffer = true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;vim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;keymap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;n&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;n&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;-- code&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;buffer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue till the end&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to stop capturing the traffic flow and go to the end ignoring all breakpoints, remove all breakpoints and do &lt;code&gt;.c&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/170jkzh/how_to_reload_plugin_when_developing_them/&#34;&gt;Reload the plugin without exiting nvim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; If you are using lazy.nvim, there is a feature that lazy.nvim provides for this purpose:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Lazy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;reload&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;your_plugin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;your_plugin2&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; These are all the tests for the &lt;code&gt;clockin&lt;/code&gt; method,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now you can run the test with &lt;code&gt;:PlenaryBustedFile %&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuring neotest to run the tests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;:PlenaryBustedFile %&lt;/code&gt; is not comfortable, that&#39;s why we&#39;re going to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest?tab=readme-ov-file&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;neotest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Configure it with:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

PreDown = iptables -D OUTPUT ! -o %i -m mark ! --mark $(wg show %i fwmark) -m addrtype ! --dst-type LOCAL -j REJECT
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ‘PostUp’ and ‘PreDown’ fields have been added to specify an iptables command which, when used with interfaces that have a peer that specifies 0.0.0.0/0 as part of the ‘AllowedIPs’, works together with wg-quick’s fwmark usage in order to drop all packets that are either not coming out of the tunnel encrypted or not going through the tunnel itself. Note that this continues to allow most DHCP traffic through, since most DHCP clients make use of PF_PACKET sockets, which bypass Netfilter. When IPv6 is in use, additional similar lines could be added using ip6tables.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to allow the traffic to your LAN while keeping your kill-switch you can use:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;PostUp = iptables -I OUTPUT ! -o %i -m mark ! --mark $(wg show %i fwmark) -m addrtype ! --dst-type LOCAL -j REJECT &amp;amp;&amp;amp; iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp -d 192.168.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT

Robinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;William ha puesto palabras bonitas y claras a mis pensamientos como no lo hacia un libro desde el manifiesto comunista hace muchos años. Un análisis impoluto sobre la crisis del capitalismo y el mundo al que nos estamos dirigiendo. A la vez que dando una dirección a la que apuntar para combatirlo. Ambiciosa y difícil, pero la que más me cuadra. Me encantaría debatirlo con la gente y lo regalaré allá donde vaya. Da un poco de yuyu porque hasta el final final final no da atisbo de luz al final del túnel tan necesaria en estos tiempos oscuros, pero aguantad, que merece la pena (✿◠‿◠).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;cover&#34; src=&#34;../../img/the_global_police_state.webp&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A muchos nos aterra el nuevo auge del fascismo. Solo en Europa, la extrema derecha integra cinco gobiernos y tiene representación parlamentaria destacada en veintisiete países. Pero esto es apenas la punta del iceberg de un proceso bastante más complejo: el auge del Estado policial global como respuesta a la profunda crisis del sistema capitalista actual. A medida que el neoliberalismo dispara las desigualdades hasta límites insospechados (los veintiséis millonarios más importantes del mundo poseen hoy más de la mitad de la riqueza mundial mientras dos mil millones de personas viven en situación de pobreza), los individuos se vuelven «desechables». Una población excedente que supone una amenaza de rebelión para la clase capitalista. Para refrenarla, se hacen ubicuos todo tipo de sistemas de control, rastreos biométricos, encarcelamientos generalizados, barcos‐prisión, violencia policial, persecución de migrantes, represión contra activistas medioambientales, eliminación de prestaciones sociales, desahucios, precarización de las clases medias, guerras estratégicas sustentadas por capital privado... Así, el Estado policial global no remite ya a un mecanismo policial y militar, sino a la propia economía global como totalidad represiva, cuya lógica es tan mercantil como política y cultural. Y, mientras la codicia infinita de la clase dominante hunde al capitalismo en una crisis sin precedentes (llevando la degradación ecológica y el deterioro social a su límite absoluto), el neofascismo afianza su posición en ese Estado policial global cuyo objetivo es la exclusión coercitiva de la humanidad excedente. Basándose en datos estremecedores y argumentos incontrovertibles, William I. Robinson demuestra hasta qué punto el capitalismo del siglo XXI se ha convertido en un sistema absoluto de represión como único método para mantenerse en pie más allá de sus contradicciones terminales, y defiende la urgencia de crear un movimiento que trascienda los meros llamados a la justicia social y ataque a la yugular.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://joyfulmilitancy.com/&#34;&gt;Joyful militancy by carla bergman and Nick Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Un libro muy interesante desde todas las perspectivas. Por cómo debió de ser el proceso creativo, por el cuidado y respeto a todos los distintos movimientos que representa, por las personas entrevistadas y las ideas que transmiten... Para mi ha sido un libro clave para una de las transformaciones más importantes de concepto de vida que he dado este año, entrar más en contacto con mi deseo y dejar que este fluya sobre las rigideces autoimpuestas entre otras cosas por el concepto del deber. Esto aplicado a mi vida en general y a mi militancia en particular.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Es cierto que la mayor parte de los conceptos transgresores son heredados del feminismo, pero el libro los refleja muy bien y puede ser un buen punto de entrada para los que no nos hemos zambullido aún muy profundamente en leer teoría feminista.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;cover&#34; src=&#34;../../img/joyful.webp&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why do radical movements and spaces sometimes feel laden with fear, anxiety, suspicion, self-righteousness and competition? The authors call this phenomenon rigid radicalism: congealed and toxic ways of relating that have seeped into radical movements, posing as the ‘correct’ way of being radical. In conversation with organizers and intellectuals from a wide variety of currents, the authors explore how rigid radicalism smuggles itself into radical spaces, and how it is being undone. Rather than proposing ready-made solutions, they amplify the questions that are already being asked among movements. Fusing together movement-based perspectives and contemporary affect theory, they trace emergent forms of trust, care and responsibility in a wide variety of radical currents today, including indigenous resurgence, anarchism, transformative justice, and youth liberation. Joyful Militancy foregrounds forms of life in the cracks of Empire, revealing the ways that fierceness, tenderness, curiosity, and commitment can be intertwined.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interviewees include Silvia Federici, adrienne maree brown, Marina Sitrin, Gustavo Esteva, Tasnim Nathoo, Kian Cham, Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, Sebastian Touza, Walidah Imarisha, Margaret Killjoy, Glen Coulthard, Richard Day, Melanie Matining, Zainab Amadahy and Mik Turje.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://piedrapapellibros.com/producto/verano-sin-vacaciones-las-hijas-de-la-costa-del-sol/&#34;&gt;Verano sin vacaciones. Las hijas de la Costa del Sol por Ana geranios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Libro que dolorosamente me quitó la venda de los ojos en cuanto al turismo y la restauración. Tiene un formato perfecto, la primera parte (Verano sin vacaciones) te llega a la patata haciéndote vivir en las entrañas lo podrido que está el sector y luego en la segunda (Las hijas de la Costa del Sol) le da forma de ensayo y te llega al coco.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lo leímos en un club de lectura muy chulo organizado por la Escuela de las Periferias, que junto a Estuve aquí y me acordé de nosotros de Anna Pacheco, nos ayudó a tener unas discusiones super interesantes que terminaron de definir mi nuevo concepto sobre el turismo. Además tuve la suerte de asistir a una mesa redonda impresionante con Ana, Valeria del Sindicato de Inquilinas y dos compas de la PAH que le dieron distintos matices a la problemática de la vivienda que tenemos que sufrir. Y para colmo luego estuvimos rajando en un parque con Ana y luego dimos un paseo por el barrio. Un final maravilloso para un libro fantástico.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;cover&#34; src=&#34;../../img/Verano-sin-vacaciones.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;¿Cómo sería un mundo sin hostelería? ¿Es posible pensar en una sociedad en la que ninguna persona tuviera que servir ni ser servida, donde las bandejas no tuvieran ninguna utilidad?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Este libro no va de eso. Es justo lo contrario: el análisis de un sector económico que se enriquece gracias al trabajo de quienes se dedican a servir a un público que puede permitírselo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Verano sin vacaciones es el diario de una trabajadora del sector hostelero de la costa malagueña; un relato al que se suma Las hijas de la Costa del Sol, un ensayo situado que nos interpela como turistas, pero también nos hace comprender qué hay detrás de una industria que descansa sobre la explotación laboral, el servilismo político y la voracidad ecológica.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;El leitmotiv es hacernos preguntas, dialogar, pensar, compartir; imaginarnos, ahora sí, cómo sería un mundo sin hostelería.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://donellameadows.org/systems-thinking-book-sale/&#34;&gt;Thinking in systems by Donella H. Meadows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Me ha encantado. Al principio dudaba de la autora por no saber de que pie cojeaba pero al final es un libro que abre mentes. Muchas ganas de resumirlo. Al principio del año descubrí el concepto de &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking&#34;&gt;systems thinking&lt;/a&gt; a way of making sense of the complexity of the world by looking at it in terms of wholes and relationships rather than by splitting it down into its parts. It has been used as a way of exploring and developing effective action in complex contexts, enabling systems change. Systems thinking draws on and contributes to systems theory and the system sciences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Me maravilló la idea de tener un sistema nuevo y sistemático de analizar el mundo, me encantan los modelos y creo que systems thinking puede llegar a ser muy potente. De los cuatro libros que me leí del tema este es sin duda el mejor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;cover&#34; src=&#34;&#34;/&gt; This is a primer that brings you to a tangible world where anyone can understand systems and engage with them in meaningful ways. The problems we face – war, hunger, poverty, climate change, racism, gender-based violence cannot be solved by quick fixes in isolation. We need to see the whole system and reach deeper to the structures and mindsets that are at play. Written with a hopeful and visionary tone, Thinking in Systems helps readers overcome confusion and helplessness, which is a first step in the work of change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novela&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://edurneportela.com/mejor-la-ausencia/&#34;&gt;Mejor la ausencia de Edurne Portela&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lo empecé el 6 de marzo y esa noche me leí 209 páginas. A las 5:35 dije que ya era suficiente, aunque me fuese rabia no terminarmelo en un día. Hoy ha caído en la madrugada del 7 al 8 de marzo. Muy icónico todo, ya no me da rabia haberlo acabado hoy. Me ha maravillado, cómo escribe Edurne, es una pasada. Te coje con la primera frase y es tu cuerpo el que suplica que dejes de leer. No hay piedad. El cambio de lenguaje a medida que va avanzando la vida de Amaia es alucinante . Cómo le da un repaso a todo el conflicto de Euskadi visto desde alguien que sin estar dentro está salpicada. No se si tuvo miedo al publicarlo, es bastante crítica con toda la movida. Me sorprende porque ella si que está politizada. He pensado que me gustaría preguntarle su opinión respecto a lo que pasó y como ella lo vivió. He pensado varias veces a lo largo de la novela si es autobiográfica. Es impresionante que sea su primera novela.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ha sido un año del (no estoy seguro de si bien llamado) conflicto vasco, ya que también leí Las fieras de Clara Usón que también me gustó mucho.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;cover&#34; src=&#34;../../img/mejor_la_ausencia.webp&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crecer siempre implica alguna forma de violencia, contra uno mismo o contra aquellos que quieren imponer su autoridad. Cuando además la vida trascurre en un pueblo de la margen izquierda del Nervión durante los años 80 y 90, y todo es heroína, paro, detritus medioambiental, cuando en las calles silban cada semana las pelotas de goma y los gases lacrimógenos y las paredes están llenas de consignas asesinas, la violencia no es sólo un problema personal. Mejor la ausencia nos presenta una familia destruida, atravesada por la violencia de su entorno. Amaia, la pequeña de cuatro hermanos, narra ese entorno brutal desde su mirada de niña y adolescente. Compartimos con ella su miedo, su perplejidad, su rabia, ante un padre que hiere, una madre que se esconde, tres hermanos que, como ella, sólo buscan salir adelante.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amaia es la joven que se enfrenta, hasta alcanzar sus propios límites, a este mundo hostil. Amaia es también la mujer que años después vuelve a su pueblo para encontrarse con un pasado irresuelto. En ese camino de ida y vuelta, en sus huidas y regresos, descubrirá, a su pesar, que nadie escapa del entorno en el que se cría, de la familia que le toca en suerte. Y que reconocerlo es la única manera de sobrevivir.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To kill a mockingbird de Harper Lee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inglés muy dificil. La historia muy bien contada, es como que todo el pueblo es de la familia. Engancha bastante.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the best-loved stories of all time, To Kill a Mockingbird has been translated into more than 40 languages, sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, served as the basis for an enormously popular motion picture, and voted one of the best novels of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century by librarians across the United States. A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father -- a crusading local lawyer -- risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lawyer Atticus Finch defends Tom Robinson -- a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. Writing through the young eyes of Finch&#39;s children Scout and Jem, Harper Lee explores with rich humor and unswerving honesty the irrationality of adult attitudes toward race and class in small-town Alabama during the mid-1930s Depression years. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina and quiet heroism of one man&#39;s struggle for justice. But the weight of history will only tolerate so much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gestión del tiempo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oliverburkeman.com/fourthousandweeks&#34;&gt;Four thousand weeks by Oliver Burkeman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Me ha encantado. Me flipa encontrar un libro de auto ayuda y time management con una perspectiva bastante anticapitalista. Probablemente es el mejor libro de gestión de tiempo que conozco, ha generado en mi esos momentos preciosos en los que surgen ideas fuera de los límites mentales que tenía antes. Ha sido bastante liberador y ha influido mucho en crear mi nueva manera de entender el tiempo y cómo navegarlo. Lo he utilizado mucho este año para rediseñar todos mis &lt;a href=&#34;roadmap_adjustments.md&#34;&gt;roadmap adjustments&lt;/a&gt;, en especial el trimestral y el anual. Muy muy recomendable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;cover&#34; src=&#34;../../img/4000_weeks.webp&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The average human lifespan is absurdly, outrageously, insultingly brief: if you live to 80, you have about four thousand weeks on earth. How should we use them best?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, nobody needs telling that there isn&#39;t enough time. We&#39;re obsessed by our lengthening to-do lists, our overfilled inboxes, the struggle against distraction, and the sense that our attention spans are shrivelling. Yet we rarely make the conscious connection that these problems only trouble us in the first place thanks to the ultimate time-management problem: the challenge of how best to use our four thousand weeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Four Thousand Weeks is an uplifting, engrossing and deeply realistic exploration of this problem. Rejecting the futile modern obsession with &#39;getting everything done,&#39; it introduces readers to tools for constructing a meaningful life, showing how the unhelpful ways we&#39;ve come to think about time aren&#39;t inescapable, unchanging truths, but choices we&#39;ve made, as individuals and as a society - and its many revelations will transform the reader&#39;s worldview.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drawing on the insights of both ancient and contemporary philosophers, psychologists, and spiritual teachers, Oliver Burkeman sets out to realign our relationship with time - and in doing so, to liberate us from its grasp.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gregmckeown.com/books/essentialism/&#34;&gt;Essentialism: The disciplined pursuit of less&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Me apesta su tono emprendedor de sueño americano y su falta de perspectiva de clase. Eso sumado a su prepotencia mandaloriana de &#34;this is the way&#34;&#34; con el essentialist path y non essentialist path hace que la lectura sea bastante horrenda. Dicho esto, si consigues abstraerte de toda esa mierda, el author aporta conceptos interesantes que me han ayudado mucho a diseñar las revisiones trimestrales y anuales del &lt;a href=&#34;roadmap_adjustments.md&#34;&gt;roadmap adjustments&lt;/a&gt;. Es especialmente interesante para aquellas personas que no sabemos decir que no y acabamos enfrascados en mil movidas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;cover&#34; src=&#34;../../img/essentialism.webp&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Essentialism isn&#39;t about getting more done in less time. It&#39;s about getting only the right things done. Have you ever found yourself stretched too thin? Do you simultaneously feel overworked and underutilized? Are you often busy but not productive? Do you feel like your time is constantly being hijacked by other people&#39;s agendas? If you answered yes to any of these, the way out is the Way of the Essentialist. Essentialism is more than a time-management strategy or a productivity technique. It is a systematic discipline for discerning what is absolutely essential, then eliminating everything that is not, so we can make the highest possible contribution toward the things that really matter. By forcing us to apply more selective criteria for what is Essential, the disciplined pursuit of less empowers us to reclaim control of our own choices about where to spend our precious time and energy -- instead of giving others the implicit permission to choose for us. Essentialism is not one more thing. It&#39;s a whole new way of doing everything. It&#39;s about doing less, but better, in every area of our lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensayo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.librosdelasteroide.com/libro/la-novia-grulla&#34;&gt;La novia grulla de CJ Hauser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Me ha encantado cómo trata temas tan complicados, su filosofía de vida y lo bien que está escrito. Una ventana a todo tipo de &#34;amor&#34; desde la &#34;nueva&#34; perspectiva feminista. Me entraron muchas ganas de leerlo ya que no paraban de mencionarlo en &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/podcasts/#punzadas_sonoras&#34;&gt;Punzadas sonoras&lt;/a&gt;, me parece que Paula e Inés me van a dar muy buen material de lectura, aunque no pueda seguirlas el ritmo ni de lejos xD.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;cover&#34; src=&#34;../../img/grulla.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Una mirada franca y divertida sobre el amor, la intimidad y la identidad en el siglo XXI.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diez días después de cancelar su boda, CJ Hauser se embarcó en una expedición a Texas para estudiar a la grulla trompetera. Tras una semana chapoteando en las marismas del golfo comprendió que había estado a punto de firmar un contrato para vivir la vida de otra persona.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;¿Qué pasaría si decidiéramos liberarnos de la idea tradicional de felicidad y nos abriéramos a lo inesperado? Hauser se sirve de su propia experiencia para explorar las relaciones sentimentales, los fracasos amorosos, la intimidad y la identidad en el siglo XXI. Disecciona la personalidad de los protagonistas de Expediente X mientras intenta entender qué es el amor, rememora sus peores citas de Tinder, chatea con desconocidos que conversan como robots y analiza a Katharine Hepburn en Historias de Filadelfia para aprender a no perderse en una relación.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Divertido, inclasificable y brutalmente sincero, este libro trata de cómo modelamos nuestra vida sentimental y nuestra comprensión de los demás a través de los relatos; una lectura para aquellos que aprenden a encontrar la alegría en el no saber e intentan, aunque a veces fracasen, construir particulares formas de vida, familia y hogar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Las dos amigas de Tony Morrison&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Un libro breve, inquietante y curioso que te hace cuestionarte a ti mismo. Me gustaría dar una reflexión más larga pero es imposible no meter spoilers. Cuando te lo leas lo hablamos :P&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;podcasts&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/podcasts/&#34;&gt;Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/podcasts/#mejores-podcasts-de-2024&#34;&gt;Mejores podcasts de 2024.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Estoy muy contento porque este año he descubierto podcast muy buenos, hasta el punto de considerar unidireccionalmente a varias de ellas ya parte de mi familia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ivoox.com/podcast-quieto-todo-mundo_sq_f11778903_1.html&#34;&gt;Quieto todo el mundo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Facu Díaz y Miguel Maldonado han conseguido alegrarme las horas de cocina de los lunes con la manera más amable de acercarme desde la comedia a la actualidad política.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;cover&#34; src=&#34;../../img/quieto_todo_el_mundo.jpeg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Con un tono divertido y relajado, en el programa van comentando desde la ignorancia, la improvisación y, en ocasiones, la desidia las noticias más importantes de la semana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Esta misa roja ha creado una verdadera religión a lo largo de los programas, no sólo por el lore sino por el vacío existencial que dejan esa semana que no publican programa. Especialmente cuando es porque los nazis les ocupan los espacios, asco de pais...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://punzadas.com/punzadas-sonoras/&#34;&gt;Punzadas sonoras&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paula Ducay e Inés García me han recordado la importancia de la Filosofía como nadie. Gracias a ellas he descubierto nuevas maneras de ver, me han regado palabras que describen a la percepción pensamientos y sensaciones que tengo y gracias con ellas he conseguido esclarecer un poco más mi entendimiento del mundo y de mi mismo. En especial han sido la base para desenterrar pilares imprescindibles de mi vida como son el deambular creativo y la solitud.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;cover&#34; src=&#34;../../img/punzadas_sonoras.jpeg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Siento que mi camino con ellas ha sido perfecto, me enamoré de ellas en los derroteros de &lt;a href=&#34;#carne-cruda&#34;&gt;Carne cruda&lt;/a&gt; de la temporada pasada (una pena enorme que no las hayan renovado). Son episodios de 20 minutos muy accesibles, y una vez que ya me enganché a ellas, los programas de una hora se hacen cortos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Escucharlas es un absoluto placer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_hay_negros_en_el_T%C3%ADbet&#34;&gt;No hay negros en el Tibet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Asaari Bibang, Lamine Thior y Frank T nos regalan un par de veces al mes una ventana a la realidad de ser una persona afrodescendiente en España. Es un podcast muy amable de escuchar, te partes con las puyas que se echan, además de ser super interesante ver el salto generacional que hay entre Frank y (Asaari y Lamine). Eso si, tienes que aprender a vivir con que se interrumpan continuamente. Al principio esto me rayó bastante ya que es especialmente irritante cuando se lo hacen a Asaari. Luego ves que no tienen filtro y no sólo se cortan entre ellas, también lo hacen con las personas invitadas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;cover&#34; src=&#34;no_hay_negros_en_el_tibet.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Una manera muy fácil de introducir el antiracismo en tu vida ya que con sus relatos eres capaz de verlo, identificártelo, aprender y corregir elementos racistas que tenemos inculcados por este sistema asqueroso. Y creo que como material divulgativo es perfecto ya que lo abordan desde un punto de vista antipunitivista nada agresivo, sin que por ello se dejen títere sin cabeza.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eldiario.es/carnecruda/&#34;&gt;Carne cruda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Violeta Muñoz y Javier Gallego han sido la voz seria de la actualidad para mi este año.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;cover&#34; src=&#34;../../img/carne_cruda.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Si es cierto que esta temporada estoy un poco más desencantado con el equipo ya que:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Ya no cuentan con Punzadas Sonoras para los derroteros y a Santiago Alba Rico nunca le he tragado.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Hace tiempo que no llaman a Pablo Elorduy del Salto, me encantaba oírle y le echo de menos :(.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Han cambiado el Nido de rojos de la temporada pasada por &#34;A diestra y siniestra&#34; en el que incluyen a peña de derechas en los debates para darle otro punto de vista. Ya se van regulando pero los primeros programas tuve que dejar de escucharlo con cabreo porque tenía que escuchar cosas como que el genocidio de palestina estaba justificado y lindezas similares. Entiendo que puede darle color al debate, pero para eso ya me voy a los medios tradicionales la verdad...&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aun así sigue siendo el referente para mi para saber qué está pasando tanto en el mundo en general como en el mundo activista.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Muriendo porque saquen más&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Este año hay unos cuantos podcast que no han continuado y que me encantarían que volviesen como:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://deesonosehabla.com/&#34;&gt;(de eso no se habla)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.soynuriaperez.com/podcast&#34;&gt;Gabinete de curiosidades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;aside class=&#34;md-source-file&#34;&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;md-source-file__fact&#34;&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;md-icon&#34; title=&#34;Last update&#34;&gt; &lt;svg viewbox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M21 13.1c-.1 0-.3.1-.4.2l-1 1 2.1 2.1 1-1c.2-.2.2-.6 0-.8l-1.3-1.3c-.1-.1-.2-.2-.4-.2m-1.9 1.8-6.1 6V23h2.1l6.1-6.1zM12.5 7v5.2l4 2.4-1 1L11 13V7zM11 21.9c-5.1-.5-9-4.8-9-9.9C2 6.5 6.5 2 12 2c5.3 0 9.6 4.1 10 9.3-.3-.1-.6-.2-1-.2s-.7.1-1 .2C19.6 7.2 16.2 4 12 4c-4.4 0-8 3.6-8 8 0 4.1 3.1 7.5 7.1 7.9l-.1.2z&#34;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;git-revision-date-localized-plugin git-revision-date-localized-plugin-timeago&#34; title=&#34;January 16, 2025 06:42:28 UTC&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;timeago&#34; datetime=&#34;2025-01-16T06:42:28+00:00&#34; locale=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;git-revision-date-localized-plugin git-revision-date-localized-plugin-iso_date&#34; title=&#34;January 16, 2025 06:42:28 UTC&#34;&gt;2025-01-16&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</description>

They are neither getting paid for their work nor do they get free admission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://angelguide.c3heaven.de/#_expectations&#34;&gt;Expectation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Helping at our events also comes with some simple, but important expectations of you:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Be on time for your shift or give Heaven early notice.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Be well rested, sober and not hungry.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Be open-minded and friendly in attitude.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Live our moral values:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Be excellent to each other.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;All creatures are welcome.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://angelguide.c3heaven.de/#_quick_start&#34;&gt;Quickstart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create yourself an &lt;a href=&#34;https://engel.events.ccc.de/&#34;&gt;Engelsystem account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Arrive at the venue&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Find &lt;a href=&#34;https://c3nav.de/&#34;&gt;the Heaven&lt;/a&gt; and go there.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Talk to a welcome angel or a shift coordinator to get your angel badge and get marked as arrived.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If you have any questions, you can always ask the shift coordinators behind the counter.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Attend an angel meeting&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Announced in the Engelsystem news&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Click yourself an interesting shift&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Read shift descriptions first&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Participate in your shift&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use the navigation to find the right place.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Arrive a little bit early at the meeting point&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Rest for at least one hour&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Repeat from step 5&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;And always, have a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To get more insights read &lt;a href=&#34;https://jascha.wtf/angels-at-chaos-about-volunteering-and-fitting-in/&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://angelguide.c3heaven.de/#_the_engelsystem&#34;&gt;The engelsystem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://engel.events.ccc.de/&#34;&gt;Engelsystem&lt;/a&gt; is the central place to distribute the work to all the helping angels. It can be a bit overwhelming at the beginning but you will get used to it and find your way around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you might have seen there are many different shifts and roles for angels — some sounding more appealing than others. There are shifts where you need to have some knowledge before you can take them. This knowledge is given in introduction meetings or by taking an unrestricted shift in the team and getting trained on the job. These introduction meetings are announced in the Engelsystem under the tab &#34;Meetings&#34;. Heaven and the teams try to make sure that there are only restrictions for shifts in place where they are absolutely needed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most restrictions really only need a meeting or some unrestricted shifts at the team to get lifted. Harder restrictions are in place where volunteers need to have special certification, get access to certain systems with a huge amount of data (e.g. mail-queues with emails from participants) or handling big piles of money. Usually the requirements for joining an angeltype are included in the description of the angeltype.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Especially the restricted shifts are tempting because after all we want to get the event running, aren’t we? From our personal experience what gets the event running are the most common things: Guarding a door, collecting bottle/trash, washing dishes in the angel kitchen, being on standby to hop in when spontaneous help is needed or check the wrist band at the entrance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If there are any further questions about angeltypes, the description of the angeltype usually includes contact data such as a DECT number or an e-mail address that can be used. Alternatively, you can also ask one of the persons of the respective angeltype mentioned under &#34;Supporter&#34;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://angelguide.c3heaven.de/#_teams&#34;&gt;Teams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Congress is organized from different teams, each with its own area of expertise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All teams are self-organized and provide their own set of services to the event.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Teams spawn into existence by a need not fulfilled. They are seldom created by an authority.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://angelguide.c3heaven.de/#_teams&#34;&gt;different teams&lt;/a&gt; to see which one suits you best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jascha.wtf/angels-at-chaos-about-volunteering-and-fitting-in/&#34;&gt;Some poeple&lt;/a&gt; suggest not to try to fit into special roles at your first event. The roles will find you – not the other way around. Our com­mu­ni­ty is not about per­so­nal gro­wing but about con­tri­bu­ting to each other and gro­wing by doing this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being an angel also comes with some perks. While we hope that participation is reward enough, here is a list of things that are exclusive to angels:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Community acknowledgement&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Hanging out in Heaven and the angel hack center with its chill out area&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Free coffee and (sparkling) water&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Warm drinks or similar to make the cold night shifts more bearable&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have contributed a certain amount of time, you may receive access to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fantastic hot vegan and vegetarian meals&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The famous limited™ angel T-shirt in Congress design&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Maybe some other perks&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 id=&#34;life-management&#34;&gt;Life Management&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;time-management&#34;&gt;Time management&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;orgzly&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/orgzly/&#34;&gt;Orgzly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;New: Migrate from Orgzly to Orgzly Revived.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;life-chores-management&#34;&gt;Life chores management&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;himalaya&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/himalaya/&#34;&gt;himalaya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Correction: Tweak the bindings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Move forward and backwards in the history of emails:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Better bindings for the email list view:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;          &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;-- Refresh emails&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It gave me better result than &lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using wkhtmltopdf&lt;/strong&gt; To convert the given HTML into a PDF with proper styling and formatting using a simple method on Linux, you can use &lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf&lt;/code&gt; with some custom options.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, ensure that you have &lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf&lt;/code&gt; installed on your system. If not, install it using your package manager (e.g., Debian: &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, convert the HTML to PDF using &lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf&lt;/code&gt; with the following command:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;wkhtmltopdf&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--page-size&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;A4&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--margin-top&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;15mm&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--margin-bottom&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;15mm&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--encoding&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;utf8&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;input.html&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;output.pdf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this command: - &lt;code&gt;--page-size A4&lt;/code&gt;: Sets the paper size to A4. - &lt;code&gt;--margin-top 15mm&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--margin-bottom 15mm&lt;/code&gt;: Adds top and bottom margins of 15 mm to the PDF.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After running the command, you should have a nicely formatted &lt;code&gt;output.pdf&lt;/code&gt; file in your current directory. This method preserves most of the original HTML styling while providing a simple way to export it as a PDF on Linux.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you need to zoom in, you can use the &lt;code&gt;--zoom 1.2&lt;/code&gt; flag. For this to work you need your css to be using the &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt; sizes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/linux_snippets/#format-a-drive-to-use-a-fat32-system&#34;&gt;Format a drive to use a FAT32 system.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;mkfs.vfat&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-F&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/dev/sdX

User services are defined in &lt;code&gt;~/.config/systemd/user/&lt;/code&gt; and can be managed without root privileges.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: Check the docker images sorted by size.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;images&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--format&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}\t{{.Size}}&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;sort&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-k2&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-h

Packaged versions might be outdated and incompatible with most recent Android handsets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Download &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-linux.zip&#34;&gt;the latest toolset&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Extract it somewhere in your filesystem&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create links to the programs you want to use in your &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next you will need to enable debugging on the Android device you are testing. &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb&#34;&gt;Please follow the official instructions on how to do so.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecting over USB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To use &lt;code&gt;adb&lt;/code&gt; with a device connected over USB, you must enable USB debugging in the device system settings, under Developer options. On Android 4.2 (API level 17) and higher, the Developer options screen is hidden by default.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enable the Developer options&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To make it visible, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable&#34;&gt;enable Developer options&lt;/a&gt;. On Android 4.1 and lower, the Developer options screen is available by default. On Android 4.2 and higher, you must enable this screen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;On your device, find the Build number option (Settings &amp;gt; About phone &amp;gt; Build number)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Tap the Build Number option seven times until you see the message You are now a developer! This enables developer options on your device.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Return to the previous screen to find Developer options at the bottom.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enable USB debugging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before you can use the debugger and other tools, you need to enable USB debugging, which allows Android Studio and other SDK tools to recognize your device when connected via USB.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enable USB debugging in the device system settings under Developer options. You can find this option in one of the following locations, depending on your Android version:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Android 9 (API level 28) and higher: Settings &amp;gt; System &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; Developer Options &amp;gt; USB debugging&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Android 8.0.0 (API level 26) and Android 8.1.0 (API level 27): Settings &amp;gt; System &amp;gt; Developer Options &amp;gt; USB debugging&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Android 7.1 (API level 25) and lower: Settings &amp;gt; Developer Options &amp;gt; USB debugging&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Test it works&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If everything is configured appropriately you should see your device when launching the command &lt;code&gt;adb devices&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Create udev rules if it fails&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you see the next error:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;failed to open device: Access denied (insufficient permissions)

* failed to start daemon
adb: failed to check server version: cannot connect to daemon
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It indicates an issue with permissions when &lt;code&gt;adb&lt;/code&gt; tries to communicate with the device via USB. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Check USB permissions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the USB device. If you&#39;re running on Linux, check if the device has appropriate udev rules.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can try adding your user to the &lt;code&gt;plugdev&lt;/code&gt; group:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;usermod&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-aG&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;plugdev&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$USER&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make sure you have a &lt;code&gt;udev&lt;/code&gt; rule for Android devices in &lt;code&gt;/etc/udev/rules.d/&lt;/code&gt;. If not, you can create one by adding a file like &lt;code&gt;51-android.rules&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;touch&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Add this line to the file to grant access to Android devices:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;SUBSYSTEM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;usb&#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ATTR&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;idVendor&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;18d1&#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;MODE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;0666&#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;GROUP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;plugdev&#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reload the &lt;code&gt;udev&lt;/code&gt; rules:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;udevadm&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;control&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--reload-rules

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unplug and reconnect the USB device. &lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools&#34;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 id=&#34;other&#34;&gt;Other&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Correction: Deprecate not-by-ai.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As they have introduced pricing, which makes no sense, and we had a discussion that using that badge it&#39;s a nice way to tell the AI which content to use and which not to&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;aside class=&#34;md-source-file&#34;&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;md-source-file__fact&#34;&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;md-icon&#34; title=&#34;Last update&#34;&gt; &lt;svg viewbox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M21 13.1c-.1 0-.3.1-.4.2l-1 1 2.1 2.1 1-1c.2-.2.2-.6 0-.8l-1.3-1.3c-.1-.1-.2-.2-.4-.2m-1.9 1.8-6.1 6V23h2.1l6.1-6.1zM12.5 7v5.2l4 2.4-1 1L11 13V7zM11 21.9c-5.1-.5-9-4.8-9-9.9C2 6.5 6.5 2 12 2c5.3 0 9.6 4.1 10 9.3-.3-.1-.6-.2-1-.2s-.7.1-1 .2C19.6 7.2 16.2 4 12 4c-4.4 0-8 3.6-8 8 0 4.1 3.1 7.5 7.1 7.9l-.1.2z&#34;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;git-revision-date-localized-plugin git-revision-date-localized-plugin-timeago&#34; title=&#34;November 28, 2024 06:46:58 UTC&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;timeago&#34; datetime=&#34;2024-11-28T06:46:58+00:00&#34; locale=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;git-revision-date-localized-plugin git-revision-date-localized-plugin-iso_date&#34; title=&#34;November 28, 2024 06:46:58 UTC&#34;&gt;2024-11-28&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</description>

You should find a pre-built binary matching your OS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Himalaya CLI &lt;code&gt;v1.0.0&lt;/code&gt; can also be installed with &lt;a href=&#34;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/&#34;&gt;cargo&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pimalaya/himalaya?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration&#34;&gt;Configuration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just run &lt;code&gt;himalaya&lt;/code&gt;, the wizard will help you to configure your default account.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can also manually edit your own configuration, from scratch:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Copy the content of the documented &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pimalaya/himalaya/blob/master/config.sample.toml&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;./config.sample.toml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Paste it in a new file &lt;code&gt;~/.config/himalaya/config.toml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Edit, then comment or uncomment the options you want&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If using mbrsync&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My generic configuration for an mbrsync account is:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;[accounts.account_name]

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you&#39;ve set it then you need to &lt;a href=&#34;#cannot-find-maildir-matching-name-inbox&#34;&gt;fix the INBOX directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then you can check if it works by running &lt;code&gt;himalaya envelopes list -a lyz-example&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vim plugin installation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using lazy:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can then run &lt;code&gt;:Himalaya account_name&lt;/code&gt; and it will open himalaya in your editor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configure the account bindings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To avoid typing &lt;code&gt;:Himalaya account_name&lt;/code&gt; each time you want to check the email you can set some bindings:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kr&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;You still need to open again &lt;code&gt;:Himalaya account_name&lt;/code&gt; as the plugin does not reload if there are new emails.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show notifications when emails arrive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can set up &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/mirador/&#34;&gt;mirador&lt;/a&gt; to get those notifications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not there yet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pimalaya/himalaya-vim/issues/8&#34;&gt;With the vim plugin you can&#39;t switch accounts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pimalaya/himalaya-vim/issues/12&#34;&gt;Let the user delete emails without confirmation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pimalaya/himalaya-vim/issues/13&#34;&gt;Fetching emails from within vim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pimalaya/himalaya/issues/490&#34;&gt;Cannot find maildir matching name INBOX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mbrsync&lt;/code&gt; uses &lt;code&gt;Inbox&lt;/code&gt; instead of the default &lt;code&gt;INBOX&lt;/code&gt; so it doesn&#39;t find it. In theory you can use &lt;code&gt;folder.alias.inbox = &#34;Inbox&#34;&lt;/code&gt; but it didn&#39;t work with me, so I finally ended up doing a symbolic link from &lt;code&gt;INBOX&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Inbox&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cannot find maildir matching name Trash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That&#39;s because the &lt;code&gt;Trash&lt;/code&gt; directory does not follow the Maildir structure. I had to create the &lt;code&gt;cur&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;tmp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; directories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pimalaya/himalaya&#34;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pimalaya/himalaya-vim&#34;&gt;Vim plugin source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: Introduce mailbox.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mailbox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a python library to work with MailDir and mbox local mailboxes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s part of the core python libraries, so you don&#39;t need to install anything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The docs are not very pleasant to read, so I got most of the usage knowledge from these sources:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pymotw.com/2/mailbox/&#34;&gt;pymowt docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cr-net.be/posts/maildir_cleanup_with_python/&#34;&gt;Cleanup maildir directories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/tyndyll/6f6145f8b1e82d8b0ad8&#34;&gt;Parsing maildir directories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that an account can have many mailboxes (INBOX, Sent, ...), there is no &#34;root mailbox&#34; that contains all of the other&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;initialise a mailbox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mbox&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mailbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Maildir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;path/to/your/mailbox&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Where the &lt;code&gt;path/to/your/mailbox&lt;/code&gt; is the directory that contains the &lt;code&gt;cur&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;tmp&lt;/code&gt; directories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working with mailboxes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not very clear how to work with them, the Maildir mailbox contains the emails in iterators &lt;code&gt;[m for m in mbox]&lt;/code&gt;, it acts kind of a dictionary, you can get the keys of the emails with &lt;code&gt;[k for k in mbox.iterkeys]&lt;/code&gt;, and then you can &lt;code&gt;mbox[key]&lt;/code&gt; to get an email, you cannot modify those emails (flags, subdir, ...) directly in the &lt;code&gt;mbox&lt;/code&gt; object (for example &lt;code&gt;mbox[key].set_flags(&#39;P&#39;)&lt;/code&gt; doesn&#39;t work). You need to &lt;code&gt;mail = mbox.pop(key)&lt;/code&gt;, do the changes in the &lt;code&gt;mail&lt;/code&gt; object and then &lt;code&gt;mbox.add(mail)&lt;/code&gt; it again, with the downside that after you added it again, the &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; has changed! But it&#39;s the return value of the &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the program gets interrupted between the &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; then you&#39;ll loose the email. The best way to work with it would be then:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;mail = mbox.get(key)&lt;/code&gt; the email&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Do all the process you need to do with the email&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;mbox.pop(key)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;key = mbox.add(mail)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;In theory &lt;code&gt;mbox&lt;/code&gt; has an &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; method that does this, but I don&#39;t understand it and it doesn&#39;t work as expected :S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving emails around&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can&#39;t just move the files between directories like you&#39;d do with python as each directory contains it&#39;s own identifiers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving a message between the maildir directories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Message&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;set_subdir&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pymotw.com/2/mailbox/#maildir-folders&#34;&gt;Creating folders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though you can create folders with &lt;code&gt;mailbox&lt;/code&gt; it creates them in a way that mbsync doesn&#39;t understand it. It&#39;s easier to manually create the &lt;code&gt;cur&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tmp&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; directories. I&#39;m using the next function:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ow&#34;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mailbox_dir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;cur&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;exists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;ow&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;cur&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;tmp&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;new&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;

Each message is assigned a file with a unique name, and each mail folder is a file system directory containing these files.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Maildir directory (often named Maildir) usually has three subdirectories named &lt;code&gt;tmp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;cur&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;tmp&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory temporarily stores e-mail messages that are in the process of being delivered. This subdirectory may also store other kinds of temporary files.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory stores messages that have been delivered, but have not yet been seen by any mail application.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;cur&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory stores messages that have already been seen by mail applications.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/mbsync/#my-emails-are-not-being-deleted-on-the-source-imap-server&#34;&gt;My emails are not being deleted on the source IMAP server.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That&#39;s the default behavior of &lt;code&gt;mbsync&lt;/code&gt;, if you want it to actually delete the emails on the source you need to add:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Expunge Both
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Under your channel (close to &lt;code&gt;Sync All&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Create Both&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/mbsync/#mbsync-error:-uid-is-beyond-highest-assigned-uid&#34;&gt;Mbsync error: UID is beyond highest assigned UID.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If during the sync you receive the following errors:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;mbsync error: UID is 3 beyond highest assigned UID 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Go to the place where &lt;code&gt;mbsync&lt;/code&gt; is storing the emails and find the file that is giving the error, you need to find the files that contain &lt;code&gt;U=3&lt;/code&gt;, imagine that it&#39;s something like &lt;code&gt;1568901502.26338_1.hostname,U=3:2,S&lt;/code&gt;. You can strip off everything from the &lt;code&gt;,U=&lt;/code&gt; from that filename and resync and it should be fine, e.g.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;mv&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;1568901502.26338_1.hostname,U=3:2,S&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;1568901502.26338_1.hostname&#39;&lt;/span&gt;

It logs the output in &lt;code&gt;logfmt&lt;/code&gt; format so that it&#39;s easily handled by &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/loki/&#34;&gt;loki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To run it you&#39;ll first need to create a virtualenv, I use &lt;code&gt;mkvirtualenv account_syncer&lt;/code&gt; which creates a virtualenv in &lt;code&gt;~/.local/share/virtualenv/account_syncer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then install the dependencies:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;aiocron
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then place this script somewhere, for example (&lt;code&gt;~/.local/bin/account_syncer.py&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;asyncio&lt;/span&gt;

This package provides bindings for systemd functionality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Install it using pip:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;systemd-python
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Below is an example Python script that configures logging to send messages to the systemd journal:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;getLogger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;my_app&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;setLevel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;DEBUG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Set the logging level&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;journal_handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;setFormatter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;formatter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;addHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;journal_handler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;This is an info message.&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;This is an error message.&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;Debugging information.&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you run the script, the log messages will be sent to the systemd journal. You can view them using the &lt;code&gt;journalctl&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;journalctl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-f
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This command will show the latest log entries in real time. You can filter by your application name using:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;journalctl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-f&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-t&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;my_app
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Replace &lt;code&gt;my_app&lt;/code&gt; with the logger name you used (e.g., &lt;code&gt;&#39;my_app&#39;&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Tips&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Tagging&lt;/strong&gt;: You can add a custom identifier for your logs by setting &lt;code&gt;logging.getLogger(&#39;your_tag&#39;)&lt;/code&gt;. This will allow you to filter logs using &lt;code&gt;journalctl -t your_tag&lt;/code&gt;. - &lt;strong&gt;Log Levels&lt;/strong&gt;: You can control the verbosity of the logs by setting different levels (e.g., &lt;code&gt;DEBUG&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;INFO&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WARNING&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ERROR&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CRITICAL&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example Output in the Systemd Journal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You should see entries similar to the following in the systemd journal:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Nov 15 12:45:30 my_hostname my_app[12345]: 2024-11-15 12:45:30,123 - my_app - INFO - This is an info message.
Nov 15 12:45:30 my_hostname my_app[12345]: 2024-11-15 12:45:30,124 - my_app - ERROR - This is an error message.
Nov 15 12:45:30 my_hostname my_app[12345]: 2024-11-15 12:45:30,125 - my_app - DEBUG - Debugging information.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This approach ensures that your logs are accessible through standard systemd tools and are consistent with other system logs.

Look for the pool name you want to import.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Import the pool: If you see the pool listed and you know its name (let&#39;s say the pool name is &lt;code&gt;mypool&lt;/code&gt;), you can import it with:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;zpool&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;import&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;mypool
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Import the pool from a specific device: If the pool isn&#39;t showing up or you want to specify the device directly, you can use:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;zpool&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;import&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-d&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/dev/sdf2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This tells ZFS to look specifically at &lt;code&gt;/dev/sdf2&lt;/code&gt; for any pools. If you don&#39;t know the name of the pool this is also the command to run.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This should list any pools found on the device. If it shows a pool, import it using:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;zpool&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;import&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-d&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/dev/sdf2&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;pool_name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Mount the pool: Once the pool is imported, ZFS should automatically mount any datasets associated with the pool. You can check the status of the pool with:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;zpool&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;status
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additional options:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;If the pool was exported cleanly, you can use &lt;code&gt;zpool import&lt;/code&gt; without additional flags.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If the pool wasn’t properly exported or was interrupted, you might need to use &lt;code&gt;-f&lt;/code&gt; (force) to import it:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;zpool&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;import&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-f&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;mypool
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; feat(linux_snippets#Create a systemd service for a non-root user): Create a systemd service for a non-root user&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To set up a systemd service as a &lt;strong&gt;non-root user&lt;/strong&gt;, you can create a user-specific service file under your home directory. User services are defined in &lt;code&gt;~/.config/systemd/user/&lt;/code&gt; and can be managed without root privileges.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create the service file:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Open a terminal and create a new service file in &lt;code&gt;~/.config/systemd/user/&lt;/code&gt;. For example, if you want to create a service for a script named &lt;code&gt;my_script.py&lt;/code&gt;, follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-p&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;~/.config/systemd/user
nano&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;~/.config/systemd/user/my_script.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Edit the service file:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;my_script.service&lt;/code&gt; file, add the following configuration:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;[Unit]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;: A short description of what the service does.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ExecStart&lt;/strong&gt;: The command to run your script. Replace &lt;code&gt;/path/to/your/script/my_script.py&lt;/code&gt; with the full path to your Python script. If you want to run the script within a virtualenv you can use &lt;code&gt;/path/to/virtualenv/bin/python&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/python3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll need to add the virtualenv path to Path &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Add virtualenv&#39;s bin directory to PATH&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;WorkingDirectory&lt;/strong&gt;: Set the working directory to where your script is located (optional). - &lt;strong&gt;Restart&lt;/strong&gt;: Restart the service if it fails. - &lt;strong&gt;StandardOutput&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;StandardError&lt;/strong&gt;: This ensures that the output is captured in the systemd journal. - &lt;strong&gt;WantedBy&lt;/strong&gt;: Specifies the target to which this service belongs. &lt;code&gt;default.target&lt;/code&gt; is commonly used for user services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reload systemd to recognize the new service:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Run the following command to reload systemd&#39;s user service files:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;systemctl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--user&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;daemon-reload
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Enable and start the service:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;To start the service immediately and enable it to run on boot (for your user session), use the following commands:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;systemctl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--user&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;start&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;my_script.service
systemctl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--user&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;enable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;my_script.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Check the status and logs:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;To check if the service is running:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;systemctl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--user&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;status&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;my_script.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;To view logs specific to your service:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;journalctl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--user&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-u&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;my_script.service&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-f
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you need to use the graphical interface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your script requires user interaction (like entering a GPG passphrase), it’s crucial to ensure that the service is tied to your graphical user session, which ensures that prompts can be displayed and interacted with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To handle this situation, you should make a few adjustments to your systemd service:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure service is bound to graphical session&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Change the &lt;code&gt;WantedBy&lt;/code&gt; target to &lt;code&gt;graphical-session.target&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;default.target&lt;/code&gt;. This makes sure the service waits for the full graphical environment to be available.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;Type=forking&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;Type=simple&lt;/code&gt; (optional)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you need the service to wait until the user is logged in and has a desktop session ready, you might need to tweak the service type. Usually, &lt;code&gt;Type=simple&lt;/code&gt; is fine, but you can also experiment with &lt;code&gt;Type=forking&lt;/code&gt; if you notice any issues with user prompts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s how you should modify your &lt;code&gt;mbsync_syncer.service&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;[Unit]&lt;/span&gt;

This can be caused by a variety of factors, including disk bottlenecks, overloaded storage systems, or inefficient applications making disk-intensive operations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s a structured approach to debug and analyze high I/O wait on your server:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;** Monitor disk I/O**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, verify if disk I/O is indeed the cause. Tools like &lt;code&gt;iostat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;iotop&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;dstat&lt;/code&gt; can give you an overview of disk activity:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;iostat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This tool reports CPU and I/O statistics. You can install it with &lt;code&gt;apt-get install sysstat&lt;/code&gt;. Run the following command to check disk I/O stats:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;iostat&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-x&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; The &lt;code&gt;-x&lt;/code&gt; flag provides extended statistics, and &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; means it will report every second. Look for high values in the &lt;code&gt;%util&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; columns, which represent: - &lt;code&gt;%util&lt;/code&gt;: Percentage of time the disk is busy (ideally should be below 90% for most systems). - &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;: Average time for I/O requests to complete.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If either of these values is unusually high, it indicates that the disk subsystem is likely overloaded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;iotop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: If you want a more granular look at which processes are consuming disk I/O, use &lt;code&gt;iotop&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;iotop&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-o
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This will show you the processes that are actively performing I/O operations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;dstat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Another useful tool for monitoring disk I/O in real-time:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;dstat&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-cdl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This shows CPU, disk, and load stats, refreshing every second. Pay attention to the &lt;code&gt;dsk/await&lt;/code&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check disk health&lt;/strong&gt; Disk issues such as bad sectors or failing drives can also lead to high I/O wait times. To check the health of your disks:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;smartctl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This tool can give you a health check of your disks if they support S.M.A.R.T.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;smartctl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-a&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/dev/sda
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Check for any errors or warnings in the output. Particularly look for things like reallocated sectors or increasing &#34;pending sectors.&#34;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;dmesg&lt;/code&gt; logs&lt;/strong&gt;: Look at the system logs for disk errors or warnings:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;dmesg&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;grep&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-i&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;error&#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;If there are frequent disk errors, it may be time to replace the disk or investigate hardware issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for disk saturation&lt;/strong&gt; If the disk is saturated, no matter how fast the CPU is, it will be stuck waiting for data to come back from the disk. To further investigate disk saturation:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;df -h&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Check if your disk partitions are full or close to full.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;df&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-h
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;lsblk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Check how your disks are partitioned and how much data is written to each partition:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;lsblk&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-o&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;NAME,SIZE,TYPE,MOUNTPOINT
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;blktrace&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: For advanced debugging, you can use &lt;code&gt;blktrace&lt;/code&gt;, which traces block layer events on your system.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;blktrace&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-d&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/dev/sda&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-o&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;blkparse&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-i&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This will give you very detailed insights into how the system is interacting with the block device.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check for heavy disk-intensive processes&lt;/strong&gt; Identify processes that might be using excessive disk I/O. You can use tools like &lt;code&gt;iotop&lt;/code&gt; (as mentioned earlier) or &lt;code&gt;pidstat&lt;/code&gt; to look for processes with high disk usage:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;pidstat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Track per-process disk activity:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pidstat&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-d&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This command will give you I/O statistics per process every second. Look for processes with high &lt;code&gt;I/O&lt;/code&gt; values (&lt;code&gt;r/s&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;w/s&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;htop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: While &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;htop&lt;/code&gt; can show CPU usage, they can also show process-level disk activity. Focus on processes consuming high CPU or memory, as they might also be performing heavy I/O operations.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;check file system issues&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes the file system itself can be the source of I/O bottlenecks. Check for any file system issues that might be causing high I/O wait.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check file system consistency&lt;/strong&gt;: If you suspect the file system is causing issues (e.g., due to corruption), run a file system check. For &lt;code&gt;ext4&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;fsck&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/dev/sda1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ensure you unmount the disk first or do this in single-user mode.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check disk scheduling&lt;/strong&gt;: Some disk schedulers (like &lt;code&gt;cfq&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;deadline&lt;/code&gt;) might perform poorly depending on your workload. You can check the scheduler used by your disk with:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can change the scheduler with:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;deadline&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This might improve disk performance, especially for certain workloads.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examine system logs&lt;/strong&gt; The system logs (&lt;code&gt;/var/log/syslog&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/var/log/messages&lt;/code&gt;) may contain additional information about hardware issues, I/O bottlenecks, or kernel-related warnings:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tail&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-f&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/var/log/syslog
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tail&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-f&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/var/log/messages
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Look for I/O or disk-related warnings or errors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider hardware upgrades or tuning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SSD vs HDD&lt;/strong&gt;: If you&#39;re using HDDs, consider upgrading to SSDs. HDDs can be much slower in terms of I/O, especially if you have a high number of random read/write operations.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAID Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;: If you are using RAID, check the RAID configuration and ensure it&#39;s properly tuned for performance (e.g., using RAID-10 for a good balance of speed and redundancy).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory and CPU Tuning&lt;/strong&gt;: If the server is swapping due to insufficient RAM, it can result in increased I/O wait. You might need to add more RAM or optimize the system to avoid excessive swapping.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check for swapping issues&lt;/strong&gt; Excessive swapping can contribute to high I/O wait times. If your system is swapping (which happens when physical RAM is exhausted), I/O wait spikes as the system reads from and writes to swap space on disk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check swap usage&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;free&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-h
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;If swap usage is high, you may need to add more physical RAM or optimize applications to reduce memory pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/linux_snippets/#create-a-file-with-random-data-&#34;&gt;Create a file with random data.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of 3.5 GB&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;dd&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/dev/urandom&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;random_file.bin&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;bs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;1M&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;3584&lt;/span&gt;

It can be used to bulk import structured data and files and more via the API, without direct access to the server.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aleph.occrp.org/developers/how-to/data/install-alephclient/#how-to-install-the-alephclient-cli&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can now install &lt;code&gt;alephclient&lt;/code&gt; using pip although I recommend to use &lt;code&gt;pipx&lt;/code&gt; instead:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;alephclient&lt;/code&gt; needs to know the URL of the Aleph instance to connect to. For privileged operations (e.g. accessing private datasets or writing data), it also needs your API key. You can find your API key in your user profile in the Aleph UI.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both settings can be provided by setting the environment variables &lt;code&gt;ALEPHCLIENT_HOST&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ALEPHCLIENT_API_KEY&lt;/code&gt;, respectively, or by passing them in with &lt;code&gt;--host&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--api-key&lt;/code&gt; options.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;ALEPHCLIENT_HOST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;https://aleph.occrp.org/
&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;ALEPHCLIENT_API_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can now start using &lt;code&gt;alephclient&lt;/code&gt; for example to upload an entire directory to Aleph.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aleph.occrp.org/developers/how-to/data/upload-directory/&#34;&gt;Upload an entire directory to Aleph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; While you can upload multiple files and even entire directories at once via the Aleph UI, using the &lt;code&gt;alephclient&lt;/code&gt; CLI allows you to upload files in bulk much quicker and more reliable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Run the following &lt;code&gt;alephclient&lt;/code&gt; command to upload an entire directory to Aleph:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;alephclient&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;crawldir&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--foreign-id&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;wikileaks-cable&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/Users/sunu/data/cable
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This will upload all files in the directory &lt;code&gt;/Users/sunu/data/cable&lt;/code&gt; (including its subdirectories) into an investigation with the foreign ID &lt;code&gt;wikileaks-cable&lt;/code&gt;. If no investigation with this foreign ID exists, a new investigation is created (in theory, but it didn&#39;t work for me, so manually create the investigation and then copy it&#39;s foreign ID).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’d like to import data into an existing investigation and do not know its foreign ID, you can find the foreign ID in the Aleph UI. Navigate to the investigation homepage. The foreign ID is listed in the sidebar on the right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/aleph/#other-tools-for-the-ecosystem&#34;&gt;Other tools for the ecosystem.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;aside class=&#34;md-source-file&#34;&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;md-source-file__fact&#34;&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;md-icon&#34; title=&#34;Last update&#34;&gt; &lt;svg viewbox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M21 13.1c-.1 0-.3.1-.4.2l-1 1 2.1 2.1 1-1c.2-.2.2-.6 0-.8l-1.3-1.3c-.1-.1-.2-.2-.4-.2m-1.9 1.8-6.1 6V23h2.1l6.1-6.1zM12.5 7v5.2l4 2.4-1 1L11 13V7zM11 21.9c-5.1-.5-9-4.8-9-9.9C2 6.5 6.5 2 12 2c5.3 0 9.6 4.1 10 9.3-.3-.1-.6-.2-1-.2s-.7.1-1 .2C19.6 7.2 16.2 4 12 4c-4.4 0-8 3.6-8 8 0 4.1 3.1 7.5 7.1 7.9l-.1.2z&#34;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;git-revision-date-localized-plugin git-revision-date-localized-plugin-timeago&#34; title=&#34;October 30, 2024 06:44:52 UTC&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;timeago&#34; datetime=&#34;2024-10-30T06:44:52+00:00&#34; locale=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;git-revision-date-localized-plugin git-revision-date-localized-plugin-iso_date&#34; title=&#34;October 30, 2024 06:44:52 UTC&#34;&gt;2024-10-30&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</description>

However, there are ways to automate the testing process. You can use libraries like &lt;code&gt;pexpect&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;pytest-mock&lt;/code&gt; to simulate user input and test the behavior of your code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s how you can approach testing &lt;code&gt;questionary&lt;/code&gt; code using &lt;code&gt;pytest-mock&lt;/code&gt; to mock &lt;code&gt;questionary&lt;/code&gt; functions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can mock &lt;code&gt;questionary&lt;/code&gt; functions like &lt;code&gt;questionary.select().ask()&lt;/code&gt; to simulate user choices without actual user interaction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing a single &lt;code&gt;questionary.text&lt;/code&gt; prompt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s assume you have a function that asks the user for their name:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You can test this function by mocking the &lt;code&gt;questionary.text&lt;/code&gt; prompt to simulate the user&#39;s input.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;your_module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ask_name&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;test_ask_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mocker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Mock the text function to simulate user input&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mock_text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mocker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;patch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;questionary.text&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Define the response for the prompt&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mock_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;return_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;Alice&#34;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test a function that has many questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of how to test a function that contains two &lt;code&gt;questionary.text&lt;/code&gt; prompts using &lt;code&gt;pytest-mock&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s assume you have a function that asks for the first and last names of a user:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;questionary&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;last_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;questionary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;What&#39;s your last name?&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;first_name&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;first_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;last_name&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;last_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can mock both &lt;code&gt;questionary.text&lt;/code&gt; calls to simulate user input for both the first and last names:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get your API key&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By default, any Aleph search will return only public documents in responses to API requests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to access documents which are not marked public, you will need to sign into the tool. This can be done through the use on an API key. The API key for any account can be found by clicking on the &#34;Settings&#34; menu item in the navigation menu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can run the script directly from the command line. Below are examples of usage:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Retrieve and list documents from a collection:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;python&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;list_aleph_collection_documents.py&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--api-key&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;your-api-key&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;Name of your collection&#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using an Environment Variable for the API Key&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is better from a security perspective. &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;API_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;your_api_key

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enabling Verbose Logging&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To enable detailed debug logs, use the &lt;code&gt;--verbose&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-v&lt;/code&gt; flag:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;python&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;list_aleph_collection_documents.py&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-v&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;Name of your collection&#39;&lt;/span&gt;

Which is better than using &lt;code&gt;tabular-py&lt;/code&gt; that requires java to be installed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/advanced.html#process-background-lines&#34;&gt;Process background lines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To detect line segments, Lattice needs the lines that make the table to be in the foreground. To process background lines, you can pass process_background=True.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;tables = camelot.read_pdf(&#39;background_lines.pdf&#39;, process_background=True)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;tables[1].df&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html&#34;&gt;Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 id=&#34;devops&#34;&gt;DevOps&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;continuous-integration&#34;&gt;Continuous Integration&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;bandit&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/devops/bandit/&#34;&gt;Bandit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/devops/bandit/#b603:-subprocess_without_shell_equals_true&#34;&gt;Solving warning B603: subprocess_without_shell_equals_true.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;B603: subprocess_without_shell_equals_true&lt;/code&gt; issue in Bandit is raised when the &lt;code&gt;subprocess&lt;/code&gt; module is used without setting &lt;code&gt;shell=True&lt;/code&gt;. Bandit flags this because using &lt;code&gt;shell=True&lt;/code&gt; can be a security risk if the command includes user-supplied input, as it opens the door to shell injection attacks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To fix it:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Avoid &lt;code&gt;shell=True&lt;/code&gt; if possible: Instead, pass the command and its arguments as a list to &lt;code&gt;subprocess.Popen&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;subprocess.run&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;subprocess.call&lt;/code&gt;, etc.). This way, the command is executed directly without invoking the shell, reducing the risk of injection attacks.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;subprocess&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Instead of this:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# subprocess.Popen(&#34;ls -l&#34;, shell=True)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Do this:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;subprocess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Popen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;ls&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;-l&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;When you must use &lt;code&gt;shell=True&lt;/code&gt;: - If you absolutely need to use &lt;code&gt;shell=True&lt;/code&gt; (e.g., because you are running a complex shell command or using shell features like wildcards), ensure that the command is either hardcoded or sanitized to avoid security risks.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Example with &lt;code&gt;shell=True&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;subprocess&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Command is hardcoded and safe&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;ls -l | grep py&#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;subprocess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Popen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the command includes user input, sanitize the input carefully:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;subprocess&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;user_input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;some_directory&#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;sa&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;ls -l &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;subprocess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;list2cmdline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;user_input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;subprocess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Popen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Even with precautions, using &lt;code&gt;shell=True&lt;/code&gt; is risky with user input, so avoid it if possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Explicitly tell bandit you have considered the risk: If you have reviewed the code and are confident that the code is safe in your particular case, you can mark the line with a &lt;code&gt;# nosec&lt;/code&gt; comment to tell Bandit to ignore the issue:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;subprocess&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;ls -l | grep py&#34;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 id=&#34;operating-systems&#34;&gt;Operating Systems&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;linux&#34;&gt;Linux&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;linux-snippets&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/linux_snippets/&#34;&gt;Linux Snippets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Correction: Docker prune without removing the manual networks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you run the command &lt;code&gt;docker system prune&lt;/code&gt; in conjunction with &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/watchtower/&#34;&gt;watchtower&lt;/a&gt; and manually defined networks you may run into the issue that the docker system prune acts just when the dockers are stopped and thus removing the networks, which will prevent the dockers to start. In those cases you can either make sure that docker system prune is never run when watchtower is doing the updates or you can split the command into the next script:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;date
&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;Pruning the containers&#34;&lt;/span&gt;

Aleph supports an extensive API for searching documents and entities. It can also be used to retrieve raw metadata, source documents and other useful details. Aleph&#39;s API tries to follow a pragmatic approach based on the following principles:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;All API calls are prefixed with an API version; this version is /api/2/.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Responses and requests are both encoded as JSON. Requests should have the Content-Type and Accept headers set to application/json.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The application uses Representational State Transfer (REST) principles where convenient, but also has some procedural API calls.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The API allows API Authorization via an API key or JSON Web Tokens.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://aleph.occrp.org/api/openapi.json#section/Authentication-and-Authorization&#34;&gt;Authentication and authorization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By default, any Aleph search will return only public documents in responses to API requests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to access documents which are not marked public, you will need to sign into the tool. This can be done through the use on an API key. The API key for any account can be found by clicking on the &#34;Profile&#34; menu item in the navigation menu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The API key must be sent on all queries using the Authorization HTTP header:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Authorization: ApiKey 363af1e2b03b41c6b3adc604956e2f66&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the API key can also be sent as a query parameter under the api_key key.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similarly, a JWT can be sent in the Authorization header, after it has been returned by the login and/or OAuth processes. Aleph does not use session cookies or any other type of stateful API.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/aleph/#crossreferencing-mentions-with-entities&#34;&gt;Crossreferencing mentions with entities.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aleph.occrp.org/developers/explanation/cross-referencing/#mentions&#34;&gt;Mentions&lt;/a&gt; are names of people or companies that Aleph automatically extracts from files you upload. Aleph includes mentions when cross-referencing a collection, but only in one direction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consider the following example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&#34;Collection A&#34; contains a file. The file mentions &#34;John Doe&#34;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&#34;Collection B&#34; contains a Person entity named &#34;John Doe&#34;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you cross-reference “Collection A”, Aleph includes the mention of “John Doe” in the cross-referencing and will find a match for it in “Collection B”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, if you cross-reference “Collection B”, Aleph doesn&#39;t consider mentions when trying to find a match for the Person entity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As long as you only want to compare the mentions in one specific collection against entities (but not mentions) in another collection, Aleph’s cross-ref should be able to do that. If you want to compare entities in a specific collection against other entities and mentions in other collections, you will have to do that yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have a limited number of collection, one option might be to fetch all mentions and automatically create entities for each mention using the API.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To fetch a list of mentions for a collection you can use the &lt;code&gt;/api/2/entities?filter:collection_id=137&amp;amp;filter:schemata=Mention&lt;/code&gt; API request.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 id=&#34;coding&#34;&gt;Coding&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;languages&#34;&gt;Languages&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;configure-docker-to-host-the-application&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/docker/&#34;&gt;Configure Docker to host the application&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/docker/#minify-the-images&#34;&gt;Minify the images.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wagoodman/dive&#34;&gt;dive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim&#34;&gt;slim&lt;/a&gt; are two cli tools you can use to optimise the size of your dockers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;python-snippets&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/coding/python/python_snippets/&#34;&gt;Python Snippets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/coding/python/python_snippets/#send-a-linux-desktop-notification&#34;&gt;Send a linux desktop notification.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To show a Linux desktop notification from a Python script, you can use the &lt;code&gt;notify2&lt;/code&gt; library (although &lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.org/project/notify2/&#34;&gt;it&#39;s last commit was done on 2017&lt;/a&gt;. This library provides an easy way to send desktop notifications on Linux.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can use the &lt;code&gt;subprocess&lt;/code&gt; module to call the &lt;code&gt;notify-send&lt;/code&gt; command-line utility directly. This is a more straightforward method but requires &lt;code&gt;notify-send&lt;/code&gt; to be installed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;subprocess&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;vm&#34;&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;__main__&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ensure the script has executable permissions. Run the following command:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;+x&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;espansadd.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;To make the &lt;code&gt;espansadd&lt;/code&gt; script easily accessible, we can configure a key binding in i3 to run the script. Open your i3 configuration file, typically located at &lt;code&gt;~/.config/i3/config&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;~/.i3/config&lt;/code&gt;, and add the following lines:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;bindsym&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$mod&lt;/span&gt;+Shift+e&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--no-startup-id&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/path/to/your/espansadd.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Replace &lt;code&gt;/path/to/your/espansadd.py&lt;/code&gt; with the actual path to your script.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you also want the popup windows to be in floating mode add&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;for_window&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;Espanso add input&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;floating&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;enable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;After editing the configuration file, reload i3 to apply the changes. You can do this by pressing &lt;code&gt;Mod&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;Shift&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; (where &lt;code&gt;Mod&lt;/code&gt; is typically the &lt;code&gt;Super&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Windows&lt;/code&gt; key) or by running the following command:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;i3-msg&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;reload
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now that everything is set up, you can use the &lt;code&gt;espansadd&lt;/code&gt; script by pressing &lt;code&gt;Mod&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;Shift&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;. This will open a dialog where you can enter the trigger and replacement text for the new Espanso snippet. After entering the information and pressing Enter, a notification will appear confirming the snippet has been added, or showing an error message if something went wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 id=&#34;operating-systems&#34;&gt;Operating Systems&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;linux&#34;&gt;Linux&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;wireguard&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/linux/wireguard/&#34;&gt;Wireguard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/linux/wireguard/#check-the-status-of-the-tunnel&#34;&gt;Check the status of the tunnel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One method is to do ping between VPN IP addresses or run command &lt;code&gt;wg show`` from the server or from the client.

If you follow the right time management system, build the right habits, and apply sufficient self-discipline, you will win the struggle with time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reality then kicks in you never win the struggle and only feel more stressed and unhappy. You realize that all the time you&#39;ve saved is automatically filled up by more things to do in a never ending feedback loop. Time feels like an unstoppable conveyor belt, bringing us new actions as fast as we can dispatch the old ones; and becoming more efficient just seems to cause the belt to speed up. Or else, eventually, to break down. It&#39;s true that you get more done, and yet, paradoxically, you only feel busier, more anxious and somehow emptier as a result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It get&#39;s even worse because &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/time_management/#importance-is-relative&#34;&gt;importance is relative&lt;/a&gt; and you may fall into &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/time_management/#be-mindful-of-the-efficiency-trap&#34;&gt;efficiency traps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heal yourself from FOMO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another problem that FOMO brings us is that it leads us to lives where you &#34;truly lived&#34; only if you&#39;ve lived all the experiences you could live. This leads to a frustrating life as the world has infinite of them, so getting a handful of them under your belt brings you no closer to a sense of having feasted on life&#39;s possibilities. You lead yourself in another &lt;a href=&#34;#be-mindful-of-the-efficiency-trap&#34;&gt;efficiency trap&lt;/a&gt; where the more you experience the more additional wonderful experiences you sarta to feel you could have on top of all those you&#39;ve already had, with the result that the feeling of existential overwhelm gets worse. To fight this existential overwhelm you can resist the urge to consume more and more experiences and embrace the idea that you&#39;re going to miss most of them. You&#39;ll then be able to focus on fully enjoying the tiny slice of experiences you actually do have time for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This FOMO fever is normal given the facts that we&#39;re more conscious of the limits of our time (after deterring the after life), the increase of choices that the world has brought us, and the internet amplifier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You do what you can do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s usual to feel as though you absolutely must do more than you can do. We live overwhelmed in a constant anxiety of fearing, or knowing for certain, that the actions we want to carry out won&#39;t fit on our available time. It looks like this feeling arises on every step of the economic ladder (shown in the works of Daniel Markovits).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The thing is that the idea in itself doesn&#39;t make any sense. You can&#39;t do more than you can do even if you must. If you truly don&#39;t have time for everything you want to do, or feel you ought to do, or that others are badgering you to do, then, well, you don&#39;t have time, no matter how grave the consequences of failing to do it all might prove to be. So technically it&#39;s irrational to feel troubled by an overwhelming to-do list. You&#39;ll do what you can, you won&#39;t do what you can&#39;t, and the tyrannical inner voice insisting that you must do everything is simply mistaken. We rarely stop to consider things so rationally, though, because that would mean confronting the painful truth of our limitations. We would be forced to acknowledge that there are hard choices to be made: which balls to let drop, which people to disappoint, which ambitions to abandon, which roles to fail at... Instead, in an attempt to avoid these unpleasant truths, we deploy the strategy that dominates most conventional advice on how to deal with busyness: we tell ourselves we&#39;ll just have to find a way to do more. So to address our busyness we&#39;re making ourselves busier still.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance is relative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem here is that you&#39;ll never be able to make time for everything that feels important. A similar mindset of the section &lt;a href=&#34;#efficiency-doesnt-give-you-more-time&#34;&gt;Efficiency doesn&#39;t give you more time&lt;/a&gt; can be applied. The reason isn&#39;t that you haven&#39;t yet discovered the right time management tricks, or applied sufficient effort, or that you&#39;re generally useless. It&#39;s that the underlying assumption is unwarranted: there&#39;s no reason to believe you&#39;ll make time for everything that matters simply by getting more done. For a start, what &#34;matters&#34; is subjective, so you&#39;ve no grounds for assuming that there will be time for everything that you, or anyone else deems important. But the other exasperating issue is that if you succeed in fitting more in, you&#39;ll find the goalposts start to shift: more things will begin to seem important, meaningful or obligatory. Acquire a reputation for doing your work at amazing speed, and you&#39;ll be given more of it. An example of this is gathered in Ruth Schwartz&#39;s book More work for mother, where it shows that when washing machines and vacuum cleaners appeared no time was saved at all, because society&#39;s standards of cleanliness rose to offset the benefits. What needs doing expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be mindful of the efficiency trap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes improving your efficiency may lead you to a worse scenario (&#34;efficiency trap&#34;) where you won&#39;t generally result in the feeling of having &#34;enough time&#34;, because, all else being equal, the demands will increase to offset any benefits. Far from getting things done, you&#39;ll be creating new things to do. A clear example of this is email management. Every time you reply to an email, there&#39;s a good chance of provoking a reply to that email, which itself may require another reply, and so on and so on. At the same time, you&#39;ll become known as someone who responds promptly to email, so more people will consider it worth their while to message you to begin with. So it&#39;s not simply that you never get though your email; it&#39;s that the process of &#34;getting through your email&#34; actually generates more email.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For most of us, most of the time, it isn&#39;t feasible to avoid the efficiency trap altogether, but you can stop believing you&#39;ll ever solve the challenge of busyness by cramming more in, because that just makes matters worse. And once you stop investing in the idea that you might one day achieve peace of mind that way, it becomes easier to find peace of mind in the present, in the midst of overwhelming demands, because you&#39;re no longer making your peace of mind dependent on dealing with all the demands. Once you stop believing that it might somehow be possible to avoid hard choices about time, it gets easier to make better ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you also have the knowledge of the existence of the efficiency traps you may detect them and try to get the benefits without the penalties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do the important stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The worst aspect of the trap is that it&#39;s also a matter of quality. The harder you struggle to fit everything in, the more of your time you&#39;ll find yourself spending on the least meaningful things. This is because the more firmly you believe it ought to be possible to find time for everything, the less pressure you&#39;ll feel to ask whether any given activity sis the best use of a portion of your time. Each time something new shows up, you&#39;ll be strongly biased in favor of accepting it, because you&#39;ll assume you needn&#39;t sacrifice any other tasks or opportunities in order to make space for it. Soon your life will be automatically filled with not just more things but with more trivial or tedious things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The important stuff gets postponed because such tasks need your full focus, which means to wait until you have a good chunk of free time and fewer small-but-urgent tasks tugging at your attention. So you spend your energy into clearing the decks, cranking through the smaller stuff to get it out of the way, only to discover that doing so takes the whole day, that the decks are filled up again overnight and that the moment for doing the important stuff never arrives. One can waste years this way, systematically postponing precisely the things one cares the most.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What&#39;s needed in these situations is to resist the urges of being on top of everything and learn to live with the anxiety of feeling overwhelmed without automatically responding by trying to fit more in. Instead of clearing the decks, decline to do so, focusing instead on what&#39;s truly of greatest consequence while tolerating the discomfort of knowing that, as you do so, the decks will be filling up further, with emails and errands and other to-dos, many of which you may never get around to at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll sometimes still decide to drive yourself hard in an effort to squeeze more in, when circumstances absolutely require it. But that won&#39;t be your default mode, because you&#39;ll no longer be operating under the illusion of one day making time for everything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluate what you miss when you increase your efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the benefits of efficiency is that you free yourself from tedious experiences, the side effect is that some times we&#39;re not conscious of being removing experiences that we valued. So even if everything runs more smoothly, smoothness is a dubious virtue, since it&#39;s often the unsmoothed textures of life that makes them livable, helping nurture the relationships that are crucial for mental and physical health, and for the resilience of our communities. For example if you buy online the groceries you miss the chance to regularly meet with your neighbours at your local grocery store.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Convenience makes things easy, but without regard to whether easiness is truly what&#39;s most valuable in any given context. When you render the process more convenient you drain it of its meaning. The effect of convenience isn&#39;t just that the given activity starts to feel less valuable, but that we stop engaging in certain valuable activities altogether, in favour of more convenient ones. Because you can stay home, order food online, and watch sitcoms on a streaming service, you find yourself doing so although you might be perfectly aware that you&#39;d have had a better time if you had met with your friends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, those aspects of life that resist being made to run more smoothly start to seem repellent. When you can skip the line and buy concert tickets on your phone, waiting in line to vote in an election is irritating. As convenience colonizes everyday life, activities gradually sort themselves into two types: the kind that are now far more convenient, but that feel empty or out of sync with our true preferences; and the kind that now seem intensely annoying because of how inconvenient they remain. Resisting all this is difficult because the Capital is winning this discourse and you&#39;ll have more pressure from your environment to stay convenient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;life-planning&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/time_management_abstraction_levels/&#34;&gt;Life planning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Correction: Tweak the month planning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Add the next steps:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Clean your agenda and get an feeling of the busyness of the month:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Open the orgmode month view agenda and clean it&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Read the rest of your calendars&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then reorder the objectives in order of priority.

These are not things to finish but rather to use as criteria for analyzing, defining a specific aspect of your life and to prioritize its projects to reach a higher outcome. We&#39;ll use areas to maintain balance and sustainability on our responsibilities as we operate in the world. Areas&#39; titles don&#39;t contain verbs as they don&#39;t model actions. An example of areas can be &lt;em&gt;health&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;travels&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;economy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To filter the projects by area I set an area tag that propagates downstream. To find the area documents easily I add a section in the &lt;code&gt;index.org&lt;/code&gt; of the documentation repository. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;vdirsyncer&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/vdirsyncer/&#34;&gt;vdirsyncer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/vdirsyncer/#database-is-locked&#34;&gt;Troubleshoot Database is locked.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First try to kill all stray vdirsyncer processes, if that doesn&#39;t work check for more solutions in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pimutils/vdirsyncer/issues/720&#34;&gt;this issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;roadmap-adjustment&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/roadmap_adjustment/&#34;&gt;Roadmap Adjustment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/roadmap_adjustment/#trimester-review&#34;&gt;Trimester review.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The objectives of the trimester review are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Identify the areas to focus on for the trimester&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Identify the tactics you want to use on those areas.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Review the previous trimester tactics&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The objectives are not:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;To review what you&#39;ve done or why you didn&#39;t get there.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to do the trimester reviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As with &lt;a href=&#34;#personal-integrity-review&#34;&gt;personal integrity review&lt;/a&gt;, it&#39;s interesting to do analysis at representative moments. It gives it an emotional weight. You can for example use the solstices or my personal version of the solstices:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Spring analysis (1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of March): For me the spring is the real start of the year, it&#39;s when life explodes after the stillness of the winter. The sun starts to set later enough so that you have light in the afternoons, the climate gets warmer thus inviting you to be more outside, the nature is blooming new leaves and flowers. It is then a moment to build new projects and set the current year on track.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Summer analysis (1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of June): I hate heat, so summer is a moment of retreat. Everyone temporarily stop their lives, we go on holidays and all social projects slow their pace. Even the news have even less interesting things to report. It&#39;s so hot outside that some of us seek the cold refuge of home or remote holiday places. Days are long and people love to hang out till late, so usually you wake up later, thus having less time to actually do stuff. Even in the moments when you are alone the heat drains your energy to be productive. It is then a moment to relax and gather forces for the next trimester. It&#39;s also perfect to develop &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;chill&lt;/em&gt; personal projects that have been forgotten in a drawer. Lower your expectations and just flow with what your body asks you.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Autumn analysis (1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of September): September it&#39;s another key moment for many people. We have it hardcoded in our life since we were children as it was the start of school. People feel energized after the summer holidays and are eager to get back to their lives and stopped projects. You&#39;re already 6 months into the year, so it&#39;s a good moment to review your year plan and decide how you want to invest your energy reserves.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Winter analysis (1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of December): December is the cue that the year is coming to an end. The days grow shorter and colder, they basically invite you to enjoy a cup of tea under a blanket. It is then a good time to get into your cave and do an introspection analysis on the whole year and prepare the ground for the coming year. Some of the goals of this season are:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Think everything you need to guarantee a good, solid and powerful spring start.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Do the year review to adjust your principles.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The year is then divided in two sets of an expansion trimester and a retreat one. We can use this information to adjust our life plan accordingly. In the expansion trimester we could invest more energies in the planning, and in the retreat ones we can do more throughout reviews.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to your desires&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trimester review requires an analysis that doesn&#39;t fill in a day session. It requires slow thinking over some time. So I&#39;m creating a task 10 days before the actual review to start thinking about the next trimester. Whether it&#39;s ideas, plans, desires, objectives, values, or principles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is useful for that document to be available wherever you go, so that in any spare time you can pop it up and continue with the train of thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doing the reflection without seeing your life path prevents you from being tainted by it, thus representing the real you of right now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the day to actually do the review, follow the steps of the &lt;a href=&#34;#month-prepare&#34;&gt;Month review prepare&lt;/a&gt; adjusting them to the trimester case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer some meaningful guided questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be done, until then you can read chapters 13, 14 and the epilogue of the book Four thousand weeks by Oliver Burkman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refactor your gathered thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve followed the prepare steps, you&#39;ve already been making up your mind on what do you want the next trimester to look like. Now it&#39;s the time to refine those thoughts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In your roadmap document add a new section for the incoming trimester similar to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Go &lt;em&gt;one by one&lt;/em&gt; (don&#39;t peek!) of your gathered items and translate them in the next sections:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Trimester analysis&lt;/code&gt;: A text with as many paragraphs as you need to order your thoughts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Trimester objectives&lt;/code&gt;: These can be concrete emotional projects you want to carry through.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Essential intent&lt;/code&gt;: This is the main headline of your trimester, probably you won&#39;t be able to define it until the last parts of the review process. It should be concrete and emotional too, it&#39;s going to be the idea that gives you strength on your weak moments and your guide to decide which projects to do and which not to.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t be too concerned on the format of the content of the objectives, this is the first draft, and we&#39;ll refine it through the planning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;content-management&#34;&gt;Content Management&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;jellyfin&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/jellyfin/&#34;&gt;Jellyfin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/jellyfin/#system.invalidoperationexception:-there-is-an-error-in-xml-document-0,-0&#34;&gt;Troubleshoot pSystem.InvalidOperationException: There is an error in XML document (0, 0).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This may happen if you run out of disk and some xml file in the jellyfin data directory becomes empty.

Built with an API-first philosophy, Kestra enables users to define and manage data pipelines through a simple YAML configuration file. This approach frees you from being tied to a specific client implementation, allowing for greater flexibility and easier integration with various tools and services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Look at this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-P0eK2xN58&#34;&gt;4 minute video&lt;/a&gt; for a visual introduction&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://kestra.io/docs/getting-started&#34;&gt;Docs&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://kestra.io/&#34;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-P0eK2xN58&#34;&gt;4 minute introduction video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;memorious&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/memorious/&#34;&gt;memorious&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: Introduce memorious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alephdata/memorious&#34;&gt;Memorious&lt;/a&gt; is a light-weight web scraping toolkit. It supports scrapers that collect structured or un-structured data. This includes the following use cases:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Make crawlers modular and simple tasks re-usable&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Provide utility functions to do common tasks such as data storage, HTTP session management&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Integrate crawlers with the Aleph and FollowTheMoney ecosystem&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alephdata/memorious&#34;&gt;Memorious&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;data-orchestrators&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/data_orchestrators/&#34;&gt;Data orchestrators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: Introduce data orchestrators.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data orchestration is the process of moving siloed data from multiple storage locations into a centralized repository where it can then be combined, cleaned, and enriched for activation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data orchestrators are web applications that make this process easy. The most popular right now are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Apache Airflow&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#kestra&#34;&gt;Kestra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Prefect&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are several comparison pages:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/geekculture/airflow-vs-prefect-vs-kestra-which-is-best-for-building-advanced-data-pipelines-40cfbddf9697&#34;&gt;Geek Culture comparison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kestra.io/vs/airflow&#34;&gt;Kestra&#39;s comparison to Airflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kestra.io/vs/prefect&#34;&gt;Kestra&#39;s comparison to Prefect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;When looking at the return on investment when choosing an orchestration tool, there are several points to consider:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Time of installation/maintenance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Time to write pipeline&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Time to execute (performance)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/kestra/&#34;&gt;Kestra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Easier to write pipelines&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Nice looking web UI&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://kestra.io/docs/getting-started/terraform&#34;&gt;terraform provider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kestra.io/docs/how-to-guides/monitoring&#34;&gt;Prometheus and grafana integration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Built in Java, so extending it might be difficult&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kestra.io/docs/developer-guide/plugins&#34;&gt;Plugins are made in Java&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kestra offers a higher ROI globally compared to Airflow:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Installing Kestra is easier than Airflow; it doesn’t require Python dependencies, and it comes with a ready-to-use docker-compose file using few services and without the need to understand what’s an executor to run task in parallel.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Creating pipelines with Kestra is simple, thanks to its syntax. You don’t need knowledge of a specific programming language because Kestra is designed to be agnostic. The declarative YAML design makes Kestra flows more readable compared to Airflow’s DAG equivalent, allowing developers to significantly reduce development time.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;In this benchmark, Kestra demonstrates better execution time than Airflow under any configuration setup.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;scrapers&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/morph_io/&#34;&gt;Scrapers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: Introduce morph.io.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://morph.io/&#34;&gt;morph.io&lt;/a&gt; is a web service that runs your scrapers for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Write your scraper in the language you know and love, push your code to GitHub, and they take care of the boring bits. Things like running your scraper regularly, alerting you if there&#39;s a problem, storing your data, and making your data available for download or through a super-simple API.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To sign in you&#39;ll need a GitHub account. This is where your scraper code is stored.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The data is stored in an sqlite&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usage limits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Right now there are very few limits. They are trusting you that you won&#39;t abuse this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, they do impose a couple of hard limits on running scrapers so they don&#39;t take up too many resources&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;max 512 MB memory&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;max 24 hours run time for a single run&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If a scraper runs out of memory or runs too long it will get killed automatically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There&#39;s also a soft limit:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;max 10,000 lines of log output&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If a scraper generates more than 10,000 lines of log output the scraper will continue running uninterrupted. You just won&#39;t see any more output than that. To avoid this happening simply print less stuff to the screen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note that they are keeping track of the amount of cpu time (and a whole bunch of other metrics) that you and your scrapers are using. So, if they do find that you are using too much they reserve the right to kick you out. In reality first they&#39;ll ask you nicely to stop.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://morph.io/documentation&#34;&gt;Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://morph.io/&#34;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;espanso&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/espanso/&#34;&gt;Espanso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: Introduce espanso.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/espanso/espanso&#34;&gt;Espanso&lt;/a&gt; is a cross-platform Text Expander written in Rust.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A text expander is a program that detects when you type a specific keyword and replaces it with something else. This is useful in many ways:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Save a lot of typing, expanding common sentences or fixing common typos.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create system-wide code snippets.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Execute custom scripts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use emojis like a pro.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://espanso.org/docs/install/linux/&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Espanso ships with a .deb package, making the installation convenient on Debian-based systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Start by downloading the package by running the following command inside a terminal:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/releases/download/v2.2.1/espanso-debian-x11-amd64.deb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can now install the package using:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;apt&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;./espanso-debian-x11-amd64.deb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;From now on, you should have the &lt;code&gt;espanso&lt;/code&gt; command available in the terminal (you can verify by running &lt;code&gt;espanso --version&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, you are ready to use &lt;code&gt;espanso&lt;/code&gt; by registering it first as a Systemd service and then starting it with:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;espanso&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;service&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;register
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Start espanso&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;espanso&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Espanso ships with very few built-in matches to give you the maximum flexibility, but you can expand its capabilities in two ways: creating your own custom matches or &lt;a href=&#34;#using-packages&#34;&gt;installing packages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://espanso.org/docs/get-started/#configuration&#34;&gt;Configuration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your configuration lives at &lt;code&gt;~/.config/espanso&lt;/code&gt;. A quick way to find the path of your configuration folder is by using the following command &lt;code&gt;espanso path&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The files contained in the &lt;code&gt;match&lt;/code&gt; directory define what Espanso should do. In other words, this is where you should specify all the custom snippets and actions (aka Matches). The &lt;code&gt;match/base.yml&lt;/code&gt; file is where you might want to start adding your matches.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The files contained in the &lt;code&gt;config&lt;/code&gt; directory define how Espanso should perform its expansions. In other words, this is were you should specify all Espanso&#39;s parameters and options. The &lt;code&gt;config/default.yml&lt;/code&gt; file defines the options that will be applied to all applications by default, unless an app-specific configuration is present for the current app.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://espanso.org/docs/get-started/#understanding-packages&#34;&gt;Using packages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Custom matches are great, but sometimes it can be tedious to define them for every common operation, especially when you want to share them with other people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Espanso offers an easy way to share and reuse matches with other people, packages. In fact, they are so important that Espanso includes a built-in package manager and a store, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.espanso.org/&#34;&gt;Espanso Hub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://espanso.org/docs/get-started/#installing-a-package&#34;&gt;Installing a package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Get the id of the package from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.espanso.org/&#34;&gt;Espanso Hub&lt;/a&gt; and then run &lt;code&gt;espanso install &amp;lt;&amp;lt;package_name&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of all the packages, I&#39;ve found the next ones the most useful:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.espanso.org/typofixer-en&#34;&gt;typofixer-en&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.espanso.org/typofixer-es&#34;&gt;typofixer-es&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.espanso.org/misspell-en-uk&#34;&gt;misspell-en-uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overwriting the snippets of a package&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example the &lt;code&gt;typofixer-en&lt;/code&gt; replaces &lt;code&gt;si&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt;, although &lt;code&gt;si&lt;/code&gt; is a valid spanish word. To override the fix you can create your own file on &lt;code&gt;~/.config/espanso/match/typofix_overwrite.yml&lt;/code&gt; with the next content:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;matches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Simple text replacement&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p p-Indicator&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;trigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&#34;si&#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&#34;si&#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://espanso.org/docs/packages/creating-a-package/&#34;&gt;Creating a package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auto-restart on config changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;auto_restart: true&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;~/.config/espanso/config/default.yml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://espanso.org/docs/configuration/options/#customizing-the-search-bar&#34;&gt;Changing the search bar shortcut&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the default search bar shortcut conflicts with your i3 configuration set it with:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;search_shortcut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain&#34;&gt;CTRL+SHIFT+e&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://espanso.org/docs/configuration/options/#hiding-the-notifications&#34;&gt;Hiding the notifications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can hide the notifications by adding the following option to your &lt;code&gt;$CONFIG/config/default.yml&lt;/code&gt; config:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;show_notifications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain&#34;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just type and you&#39;ll see the text expanded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can use the search bar if you don&#39;t remember your snippets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/espanso/espanso&#34;&gt;Code&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://espanso.org/docs/get-started/&#34;&gt;Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;generic-coding-practices&#34;&gt;Generic Coding Practices&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id=&#34;conventional-comments&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/conventional_comments/&#34;&gt;Conventional comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: Introduce conventional comments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://conventionalcomments.org/&#34;&gt;Conventional comments&lt;/a&gt; is the practice to use a specific format in the review comments to express your intent and tone more clearly. It&#39;s strongly inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/semantic_versioning/&#34;&gt;semantic versioning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s take the next comment:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;This is not worded correctly.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adding labels you can tell the difference on your intent:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;**suggestion:** This is not worded correctly.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Or &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;**issue (non-blocking):** This is not worded correctly.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Labels also prompt the reviewer to give more &lt;strong&gt;actionable&lt;/strong&gt; comments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;**suggestion:** This is not worded correctly.

Can we change this to match the wording of the marketing page?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Labeling comments encourages collaboration and saves &lt;strong&gt;hours&lt;/strong&gt; of undercommunication and misunderstandings. They are also parseable by machines!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Format&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adhering to a consistent format improves reader&#39;s expectations and machine readability. Here&#39;s the format we propose: &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt; [decorations]: &amp;lt;subject&amp;gt;

[discussion]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; - &lt;em&gt;label&lt;/em&gt; - This is a single label that signifies what kind of comment is being left. - &lt;em&gt;subject&lt;/em&gt; - This is the main message of the comment. - &lt;em&gt;decorations (optional)&lt;/em&gt; - These are extra decorating labels for the comment. They are surrounded by parentheses and comma-separated. - &lt;em&gt;discussion (optional)&lt;/em&gt; - This contains supporting statements, context, reasoning, and anything else to help communicate the &#34;why&#34; and &#34;next steps&#34; for resolving the comment. For example: &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;**question (non-blocking):** At this point, does it matter which thread has won?

Maybe to prevent a race condition we should keep looping until they&#39;ve all won?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can be automatically parsed into:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&#34;label&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;question&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&#34;subject&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;At this point, does it matter which thread has won?&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&#34;decorations&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;non-blocking&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&#34;discussion&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;Maybe to prevent a race condition we should keep looping until they&#39;ve all won?&#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Labels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We strongly suggest using the following labels: | | | | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | &lt;strong&gt;praise:&lt;/strong&gt; | Praises highlight something positive. Try to leave at least one of these comments per review. &lt;em&gt;Do not&lt;/em&gt; leave false praise (which can actually be damaging). &lt;em&gt;Do&lt;/em&gt; look for something to sincerely praise. | | &lt;strong&gt;quibble:&lt;/strong&gt; | Quibbles are trivial preference-based requests. These should be non-blocking by nature. Similar to &lt;code&gt;polish&lt;/code&gt; but clearly preference-based.| | &lt;strong&gt;suggestion:&lt;/strong&gt; | Suggestions propose improvements to the current subject. It&#39;s important to be explicit and clear on &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is being suggested and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it is an improvement. These are non-blocking proposals. If it&#39;s blocking use &lt;code&gt;todo&lt;/code&gt; instead.| | &lt;strong&gt;todo:&lt;/strong&gt; | TODO&#39;s are necessary changes. Distinguishing &lt;code&gt;todo&lt;/code&gt; comments from &lt;code&gt;issues&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;suggestions&lt;/code&gt; helps direct the reader&#39;s attention to comments requiring more involvement. | | &lt;strong&gt;issue:&lt;/strong&gt; | Issues highlight specific problems with the subject under review. These problems can be user-facing or behind the scenes. It is strongly recommended to pair this comment with a &lt;code&gt;suggestion&lt;/code&gt;. If you are not sure if a problem exists or not, consider leaving a &lt;code&gt;question&lt;/code&gt;. | | &lt;strong&gt;question:&lt;/strong&gt; | Questions are appropriate if you have a potential concern but are not quite sure if it&#39;s relevant or not. Asking the author for clarification or investigation can lead to a quick resolution. | | &lt;strong&gt;thought:&lt;/strong&gt; | Thoughts represent an idea that popped up from reviewing. These comments are non-blocking by nature, but they are extremely valuable and can lead to more focused initiatives and mentoring opportunities. | | &lt;strong&gt;chore:&lt;/strong&gt; | Chores are simple tasks that must be done before the subject can be &#34;officially&#34; accepted. Usually, these comments reference some common process. Try to leave a link to the process description so that the reader knows how to resolve the chore. | | &lt;strong&gt;note:&lt;/strong&gt; | Notes are always non-blocking and simply highlight something the reader should take note of. |&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you like to be a bit more expressive with your labels, you may also consider:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;typo:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Typo comments are like &lt;strong&gt;todo:&lt;/strong&gt;, where the main issue is a misspelling.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;polish:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Polish comments are like a &lt;strong&gt;suggestion&lt;/strong&gt;, where there is nothing necessarily wrong with the relevant content, there&#39;s just some ways to immediately improve the quality. Similar but not exactly the same as &lt;code&gt;quibble&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decorations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Decorations give additional context for a comment. They help further classify comments which have the same label (for example, a security suggestion as opposed to a test suggestion). &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;**suggestion (security):** I&#39;m a bit concerned that we are implementing our own DOM purifying function here...
Could we consider using the framework instead?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;**suggestion (test,if-minor):** It looks like we&#39;re missing some unit test coverage that the cat disappears completely.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Decorations may be specific to each organization. If needed, we recommend establishing a minimal set of decorations (leaving room for discretion) with no ambiguity. Possible decorations include: | | | | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | &lt;strong&gt;(non-blocking)&lt;/strong&gt; | A comment with this decoration &lt;strong&gt;should not&lt;/strong&gt; prevent the subject under review from being accepted. This is helpful for organizations that consider comments blocking by default. | | &lt;strong&gt;(blocking)&lt;/strong&gt; | A comment with this decoration &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; prevent the subject under review from being accepted, until it is resolved. This is helpful for organizations that consider comments non-blocking by default. | | &lt;strong&gt;(if-minor)&lt;/strong&gt; | This decoration gives some freedom to the author that they should resolve the comment only if the changes ends up being minor or trivial. |&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adding a decoration to a comment should improve understandability and maintain readability. Having a list of many decorations in one comment would conflict with this goal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More examples&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;**quibble:** `little star` =&amp;gt; `little bat`

Can we update the other references as well?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;**chore:** Let&#39;s run the `jabber-walk` CI job to make sure this doesn&#39;t break any known references.

In those cases use a broader search that includes other logs from the label you&#39;re trying to aggregate and multiply it by 0. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;(
sum by (hostname) (
  count_over_time({job=&#34;systemd-journal&#34;, syslog_identifier=&#34;sanoid&#34;}[1h])
)
or
sum by (hostname) (
  count_over_time({job=&#34;systemd-journal&#34;}[1h]) * 0
)
) &amp;lt; 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first part of the query returns all log lines of the service &lt;code&gt;sanoid&lt;/code&gt; for each &lt;code&gt;hostname&lt;/code&gt;. If one hostname were not to return any line that query alone won&#39;t show anything for that host. The second part of the query counts all the log lines of each &lt;code&gt;hostname&lt;/code&gt;, so if it&#39;s up it will probably be sending at least one line per hour. As we&#39;re not interested in those number of lines we multiply it by 0, so that the target is shown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/loki/#interact-with-loki-through-python&#34;&gt;Interact with loki through python.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.grafana.com/t/how-could-i-pull-loki-records-from-a-python-script/111483/4&#34;&gt;no client library for python&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75056462/querying-loki-logs-using-python&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75056462/querying-loki-logs-using-python&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) they suggest to interact with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/reference/loki-http-api/&#34;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;code&gt;requests&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, run the following commands:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;options&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;nouveau&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;modeset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tee&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-a&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/etc/modprobe.d/nouveau-kms.conf
sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;update-initramfs&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-u
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Update Grub to Blacklist Nouveau:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Backup your grub config template:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;cp&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/etc/default/grub&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/etc/default/grub.bak
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, update your grub config template at &lt;code&gt;/etc/default/grub&lt;/code&gt;. Add &lt;code&gt;rd.driver.blacklist=nouveau&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rcutree.rcu_idle_gp_delay=1&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX&lt;/code&gt; variable. For example, change:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;quiet&#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;quiet rd.driver.blacklist=nouveau rcutree.rcu_idle_gp_delay=1&#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, rebuild your grub config:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;grub2-mkconfig&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-o&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/boot/grub/grub.cfg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The following prerequisites should be installed before installing the Nvidia drivers:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;apt-get&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-y&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;linux-headers-&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;uname&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-r&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;make&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;gcc-4.8
sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;apt-get&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-y&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;acpid&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;dkms
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Close X Server:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before running the install, you should exit out of any X environment, such as Gnome, KDE, or XFCE. To exit the X session, switch to a TTY console using &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-Alt-F1&lt;/code&gt; and then determine whether you are running &lt;code&gt;lightdm&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;gdm&lt;/code&gt; by running:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ps&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;aux&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;grep&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;lightdm|gdm|kdm&#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Depending on which is running, stop the service, running the following commands (substitute &lt;code&gt;gdm&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;kdm&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;lightdm&lt;/code&gt; as appropriate):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;service&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;lightdm&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;stop
sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;init&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Install Drivers Only:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To accommodate GL-accelerated rendering, OpenGL and GL Vendor Neutral Dispatch (GLVND) are now required and should be installed with the Nvidia drivers. OpenGL is an installation option in the &lt;code&gt;*.run&lt;/code&gt; type of drivers. In other types of the drivers, OpenGL is enabled by default in most modern versions (dated 2016 and later). GLVND can be installed using the installer menus or via the &lt;code&gt;--glvnd-glx-client&lt;/code&gt; command line flag.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This section deals with installing the drivers via the &lt;code&gt;*.run&lt;/code&gt; executables provided by Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To download only the drivers, navigate to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html&#34;&gt;http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html&lt;/a&gt; and click the Latest Long Lived Branch version under the appropriate CPU architecture. On the ensuing page, click Download and then click Agree and Download on the page that follows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Unix drivers found in the link above are also compatible with all Nvidia Tesla models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&#39;d prefer to download the full driver repository, Nvidia provides a tool to recommend the most recent available driver for your graphics card at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.Nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us&#34;&gt;http://www.Nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are unsure which Nvidia devices are installed, the &lt;code&gt;lspci&lt;/code&gt; command should give you that information:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;lspci&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;grep&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-i&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&#34;nvidia&#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Download the recommended driver executable. Change the file permissions to allow execution:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;+x&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;./NVIDIA-Linux-&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;uname&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-m&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;-*.run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Run the install.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To check that the GPU is well installed and functioning properly, you can use the &lt;code&gt;nvidia-smi&lt;/code&gt; command. This command provides detailed information about the installed Nvidia GPUs, including their status, utilization, and driver version.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, ensure the Nvidia drivers are installed. Then, run:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvidia-smi
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the GPU is properly installed, you should see an output that includes information about the GPU, such as its model, memory usage, and driver version. The output will look something like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

It’s a low overhead tool that can perform a variety of functions including active health monitoring, diagnostics, system validation, policies, power and clock management, group configuration, and accounting. For more information, see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/dcgm/latest/dcgm-user-guide/overview.html&#34;&gt;DCGM User Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can use DCGM to expose GPU metrics to Prometheus using &lt;code&gt;dcgm-exporter&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit&#34;&gt;Install NVIDIA Container Kit&lt;/a&gt;: The NVIDIA Container Toolkit allows users to build and run GPU accelerated containers. The toolkit includes a container runtime library and utilities to automatically configure containers to leverage NVIDIA GPUs.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;apt-get&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-y&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;nvidia-container-toolkit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Configure the container runtime by using the nvidia-ctk command:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;nvidia-ctk&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;runtime&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;configure&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--runtime&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;docker
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; - Restart the Docker daemon:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;systemctl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;restart&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;docker

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Download the meta-package to set up the CUDA network repository:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$distribution&lt;/span&gt;/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Install the repository meta-data and the CUDA GPG key:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;dpkg&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-i&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Update the Apt repository cache:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;apt-get&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, install DCGM:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;apt-get&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-y&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;datacenter-gpu-manager
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enable the DCGM systemd service (on reboot) and start it now:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;systemctl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--now&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;enable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;nvidia-dcgm

By integrating with other applications, rather than reimplementing their functionality, it manages to provide a flexible set of features with high performance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/INSTALL.md#debianubuntu&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Clone the repo &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;git&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;clone&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty.git
&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;alacritty
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rustup.rs/&#34;&gt;Install &lt;code&gt;rustup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--proto&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&#39;=https&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--tlsv1.2&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-sSf&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;https://sh.rustup.rs&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;To make sure you have the right Rust compiler installed, run &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;rustup&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;override&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;stable
rustup&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;update&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;stable
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Install the dependencies &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;apt&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;cmake&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pkg-config&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;libfreetype6-dev&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;libfontconfig1-dev&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;libxcb-xfixes0-dev&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;libxkbcommon-dev&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;python3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Build the release &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;cargo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;build&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--release
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; If all goes well, this should place a binary at &lt;code&gt;target/release/alacritty&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Move the binary to somewhere in your PATH&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;mv&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;target/release/alacritty&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;~/.local/bin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; - Check the terminfo: To make sure Alacritty works correctly, either the &lt;code&gt;alacritty&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;alacritty-direct&lt;/code&gt; terminfo must be used. The &lt;code&gt;alacritty&lt;/code&gt; terminfo will be picked up automatically if it is installed. If the following command returns without any errors, the &lt;code&gt;alacritty&lt;/code&gt; terminfo is already installed:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;infocmp&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;alacritty
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;If it is not present already, you can install it globally with the following command:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;tic&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-xe&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;alacritty,alacritty-direct&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;extra/alacritty.info
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://alacritty.org/config-alacritty.html&#34;&gt;Configuration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alacritty&#39;s configuration file uses the TOML format. It doesn&#39;t create the config file for you, but it looks for one in &lt;code&gt;~/.config/alacrity/alacritty.toml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not there yet&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/50&#34;&gt;Support for ligatures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://alacritty.org/&#34;&gt;Homepage&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty&#34;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/docs/features.md&#34;&gt;Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/linux_snippets/#set-the-vim-filetype-syntax-in-a-comment&#34;&gt;Set the vim filetype syntax in a comment.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Add somewhere in your file:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;

**Connect it with Alertmanager**

It&#39;s not trivial to connect it to Alertmanager([1](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/issues/2120), [2](https://github.com/gotify/contrib/issues/21), [3](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/issues/3729), [4](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/issues/2120). The most popular way is to use [`alertmanager_gotify_bridge`](https://github.com/DRuggeri/alertmanager_gotify_bridge?tab=readme-ov-file).

We need to tweak the docker-compose to add the bridge:

```yaml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect it with Authentik&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are some guides to connect it to authentik. The problem is that the clients you want to use must support it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gotify/server/issues/203&#34;&gt;https://github.com/gotify/server/issues/203&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gotify/server/issues/553&#34;&gt;https://github.com/gotify/server/issues/553&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gotify.net/docs/&#34;&gt;Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 id=&#34;science&#34;&gt;Science&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3 id=&#34;artificial-intelligence&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/ai/&#34;&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;New: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/ai/#tools&#34;&gt;Add aider tool.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://aider.chat/&#34;&gt;Aider&lt;/a&gt; lets you pair program with LLMs, to edit code in your local git repository.
