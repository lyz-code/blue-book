# Send keystrokes to an active window

```python
import subprocess

# Type text
subprocess.run(['xdotool', 'type', 'Hello world!'])
subprocess.run(['xdotool', 'key', 'Return']) # press enter

# Key combinations
subprocess.run(['xdotool', 'key', 'ctrl+c'])

# Activate specific window first (if needed)
window_id = subprocess.check_output(['xdotool', 'getactivewindow']).decode().strip()
subprocess.run(['xdotool', 'windowactivate', window_id])

# Check if a pathlib Path is absolute or relative

```python
file_path.is_absolute()
```

# Remove a file using pathlib Path

To remove a file using Python’s `pathlib` library, you can use the `unlink()` method on a `Path` object. Here’s how it works:

```python
from pathlib import Path

file_path = Path("path/to/your/file.txt")

# Check if the file exists before trying to delete it
if file_path.exists():
    file_path.unlink()
```

This `unlink()` method will delete the file at `file_path`. If you want to handle any errors that may occur (like if the file doesn’t exist), you can wrap it in a `try-except` block:

```python
try:
    file_path.unlink()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The file does not exist.")
except PermissionError:
    print("Permission denied.")
```

# Send a linux desktop notification

## Using `notify2`

To show a Linux desktop notification from a Python script, you can use the `notify2` library (although [it's last commit was done on 2017](https://pypi.org/project/notify2/). This library provides an easy way to send desktop notifications on Linux.

Alternatively, you can use the `subprocess` module to call the `notify-send` or `dunstify` command-line utility directly. This is a more straightforward method but requires `notify-send` to be installed.

```python
import subprocess

def send_notification(title: str, message: str = "", urgency: str = "normal") -> None:
    """Send a desktop notification using notify-send.

    Args:
        title (str): The title of the notification.
        message (str): The message body of the notification. Defaults to an empty string.
        urgency (str): The urgency level of the notification. Can be 'low', 'normal', or 'critical'. Defaults to 'normal'.
    """
    subprocess.run(["notify-send", "-u", urgency, title, message])
```

# [Compare file and directories](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filecmp.html)

The filecmp module defines functions to compare files and directories, with various optional time/correctness trade-offs. For comparing files, see also the difflib module.

```python
from filecmp import dircmp

def print_diff_files(dcmp):

    for name in dcmp.diff_files:

        print("diff_file %s found in %s and %s" % (name, dcmp.left,

              dcmp.right))

    for sub_dcmp in dcmp.subdirs.values():

        print_diff_files(sub_dcmp)


dcmp = dircmp('dir1', 'dir2')

print_diff_files(dcmp)
```

# [Use Path of pathlib write_text in append mode](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57296168/pathlib-path-write-text-in-append-mode)

It's not supported you need to `open` it:

```python
with my_path.open("a") as f:
    f.write("...")
```

# [Suppress ANN401 for dynamically typed \*args and \*\*kwargs](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/677)

# [One liner conditional](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2802726/putting-a-simple-if-then-else-statement-on-one-line)

To write an if-then-else statement in Python so that it fits on one line you can use:

```python
fruit = 'Apple'
isApple = True if fruit == 'Apple' else False
```

# [Get package data relative path](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1011337/relative-file-paths-in-python-packages)

If you want to reference files from the foo/package1/resources folder you would want to use the **file** variable of the module. Inside foo/package1/**init**.py:

```python
from os import path
resources_dir = path.join(path.dirname(__file__), 'resources')
```

# [Kill a process by it's PID](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17856928/how-to-terminate-process-from-python-using-pid)

# [Expire the cache of the lru_cache](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31771286/python-in-memory-cache-with-time-to-live)

The `lru_cache` decorator caches forever, a way to prevent it is by adding one more parameter to your expensive function: `ttl_hash=None`. This new parameter is so-called "time sensitive hash", its the only purpose is to affect lru_cache. For example:

```python
from functools import lru_cache
import time


@lru_cache()
def my_expensive_function(a, b, ttl_hash=None):
    del ttl_hash  # to emphasize we don't use it and to shut pylint up
    return a + b  # horrible CPU load...


def get_ttl_hash(seconds=3600):
    """Return the same value withing `seconds` time period"""
    return round(time.time() / seconds)


# somewhere in your code...
res = my_expensive_function(2, 2, ttl_hash=get_ttl_hash())
# cache will be updated once in an hour
```

# [Fix variable is unbound pyright error](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/issues/3041)

You may receive these warnings if you set variables inside if or try/except blocks such as the next one:

```python
  def x():
    y = True
    if y:
        a = 1
    print(a)  # "a" is possibly unbound
```

The easy fix is to set `a = None` outside those blocks

```python
  def x():
    a = None
    y = True
    if y:
        a = 1
    print(a)  # "a" is possibly unbound
```

# [Get unique items between two lists](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28444561/get-only-unique-elements-from-two-lists)

If you want all items from the second list that do not appear in the first list you can write:

```
x = [1,2,3,4]
f = [1,11,22,33,44,3,4]

result = set(f) - set(x)
```

# [Pad number with zeros](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/134934/display-number-with-leading-zeros)

```

# Get the modified time of a file with Pathlib

```python
file_ = Path('/to/some/file')
file_.stat().st_mtime
```

You can also access:

- Created time: with `st_ctime`
- Accessed time: with `st_atime`

They are timestamps, so if you want to compare it with a datetime object use the `timestamp` method:

```python
assert datetime.now().timestamp - file_.stat().st_mtime < 60
```

# [Show the date in the logging module traces](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#displaying-the-date-time-in-messages)

To display the date and time of an event, you would place `%(asctime)s` in your format string:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s %(message)s')
logging.warning('is when this event was logged.')
```

# [Remove html url characters](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11768070/transform-url-string-into-normal-string-in-python-20-to-space-etc)

To transform an URL string into normal string, for example replacing `%20` with space use:

```python
>>> from urllib.parse import unquote
>>> print(unquote("%CE%B1%CE%BB%20"))
αλ
```

# Read file with Pathlib

```python

# [Sort the returned paths of glob](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6773584/how-are-glob-globs-return-values-ordered)

`glob` order is arbitrary, but you can sort them yourself.

If you want sorted by name:

```python
sorted(glob.glob('*.png'))
```

sorted by modification time:

```python
import os
sorted(glob.glob('*.png'), key=os.path.getmtime)
```

sorted by size:

```python
import os
sorted(glob.glob('*.png'), key=os.path.getsize)

```

# [Print an exception](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1483429/how-do-i-print-an-exception-in-python)

## Using the logging module

Logging an exception can be done with the module-level function
`logging.exception()` like so:

```python
import logging

try:
    1 / 0
except BaseException:
    logging.exception("An exception was thrown!")
```

```
ERROR:root:An exception was thrown!
Traceback (most recent call last):
File ".../Desktop/test.py", line 4, in <module>
    1/0
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

Notes

- The function `logging.exception()` should only be called from an exception
  handler.

- The logging module should not be used inside a logging handler to avoid a
  `RecursionError`.

It's also possible to log the exception with another log level but still show
the exception details by using the keyword argument `exc_info=True`, like so:

```python
logging.critical("An exception was thrown!", exc_info=True)
logging.error("An exception was thrown!", exc_info=True)
logging.warning("An exception was thrown!", exc_info=True)
logging.info("An exception was thrown!", exc_info=True)
logging.debug("An exception was thrown!", exc_info=True)

# or the general form
logging.log(level, "An exception was thrown!", exc_info=True)
```

## With the traceback module

### Get the error string

```python

import traceback

def cause_error():
    return 1 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError

try:
    cause_error()
except Exception as error:
    # Capture the exception traceback as a string
    error_message = "".join(traceback.format_exception(None, error, error.__traceback__))
    print("An error occurred:\n", error_message)
```

### Print directly the error

The `traceback` module provides methods for formatting and printing exceptions
and their tracebacks, e.g. this would print exception like the default handler
does:

```python
import traceback

try:
    1 / 0
except Exception:
    traceback.print_exc()
```

# [Get the difference of two lists](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2070643/subtracting-two-lists-in-python)

If we want to substract the elements of one list from the other you can use:

```python

  if x in a:
    a.remove(x)
```

# [Recursively find files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2186525/how-to-use-glob-to-find-files-recursively)

## If you only want the files and directories of the first level 


```python
from pathlib import Path

path = Path("/your/directory")
for item in path.iterdir():
    if item.is_file():
        print(f"File: {item.name}")
    elif item.is_dir():
        print(f"Directory: {item.name}")
```

## Using `pathlib.Path.rglob`

```python
from pathlib import Path

for path in Path("src").rglob("*.c"):
    print(path.name)
```

If you don't want to use `pathlib`, use can use `glob.glob('**/*.c')`, but don't
forget to pass in the recursive keyword parameter and it will use inordinate
amount of time on large directories.

## os.walk

For older Python versions, use `os.walk` to recursively walk a directory and
`fnmatch.filter` to match against a simple expression:

```python
import fnmatch
import os

matches = []
for root, dirnames, filenames in os.walk("src"):
    for filename in fnmatch.filter(filenames, "*.c"):
        matches.append(os.path.join(root, filename))
```

# [Pathlib make parent directories if they don't exist](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50110800/python-pathlib-make-directories-if-they-don-t-exist)

```python
pathlib.Path("/tmp/sub1/sub2").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
```

From the
[docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.mkdir):

- If `parents` is `true`, any missing parents of this path are created as
  needed; they are created with the default permissions without taking mode into
  account (mimicking the POSIX `mkdir -p` command).

- If `parents` is `false` (the default), a missing parent raises
  `FileNotFoundError`.

- If `exist_ok` is `false` (the default), `FileExistsError` is raised if the
  target directory already exists.

- If `exist_ok` is `true`, `FileExistsError` exceptions will be ignored (same
  behavior as the POSIX `mkdir -p` command), but only if the last path component
  is not an existing non-directory file.

# [Pathlib touch a file](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.touch)

Create a file at this given path.

```python
pathlib.Path("/tmp/file.txt").touch(exist_ok=True)
```

If the file already exists, the function succeeds if `exist_ok` is `true` (and
its modification time is updated to the current time), otherwise
`FileExistsError` is raised.

If the parent directory doesn't exist you need to create it first.

```python
global_conf_path = xdg_home / "autoimport" / "config.toml"
global_conf_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True)
global_conf_path.touch(exist_ok=True)
```

# [Get an instance of an Enum by value](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29503339/how-to-get-all-values-from-python-enum-class)

If you want to initialize a pydantic model with an `Enum` but all you have is
the value of the `Enum` then you need to create a method to get the correct
Enum. Otherwise `mypy` will complain that the type of the assignation is `str`
and not `Enum`.

So if the model is the next one:

```python
class ServiceStatus(BaseModel):
    """Model the docker status of a service."""

    name: str
    environment: Environment
```

You can't do `ServiceStatus(name='test', environment='production')`. you need to
add the `get_by_value` method to the `Enum` class:

```python
class Environment(str, Enum):
    """Set the possible environments."""

    STAGING = "staging"
    PRODUCTION = "production"

    @classmethod
    def get_by_value(cls, value: str) -> Enum:
        """Return the Enum element that meets a value"""
        return [member for member in cls if member.value == value][0]
```

Now you can do:

```python
ServiceStatus(name="test", environment=Environment.get_by_value("production"))
```

# [Fix R1728: Consider using a generator](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/messages/refactor/consider-using-generator.html)

Removing `[]` inside calls that can use containers or generators should be
considered for performance reasons since a generator will have an upfront cost
to pay. The performance will be better if you are working with long lists or
sets.

Problematic code:

```python
list([0 for y in list(range(10))])  # [consider-using-generator]
tuple([0 for y in list(range(10))])  # [consider-using-generator]
sum([y**2 for y in list(range(10))])  # [consider-using-generator]
max([y**2 for y in list(range(10))])  # [consider-using-generator]
min([y**2 for y in list(range(10))])  # [consider-using-generator]
```

Correct code:

```python
list(0 for y in list(range(10)))
tuple(0 for y in list(range(10)))
sum(y**2 for y in list(range(10)))
max(y**2 for y in list(range(10)))
min(y**2 for y in list(range(10)))
```

# [Fix W1510: Using subprocess.run without explicitly set check is not recommended](https://pycodequ.al/docs/pylint-messages/w1510-subprocess-run-check.html)

The `run` call in the example will succeed whether the command is successful or
not. This is a problem because we silently ignore errors.

```python
import subprocess


def example():
    proc = subprocess.run("ls")
    return proc.stdout
```

When we pass `check=True`, the behavior changes towards raising an exception
when the return code of the command is non-zero.

# [Use pipes with subprocess](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13332268/how-to-use-subprocess-command-with-pipes)

To use pipes with subprocess you need to use the flag `shell=True` which is
[a bad idea](https://github.com/duo-labs/dlint/blob/master/docs/linters/DUO116.md).
Instead you should use two processes and link them together in python:

```python
ps = subprocess.Popen(("ps", "-A"), stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
output = subprocess.check_output(("grep", "process_name"), stdin=ps.stdout)
ps.wait()
```

# [Copy and paste from clipboard](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11063458/python-script-to-copy-text-to-clipboard)

You can use
[many libraries](https://www.delftstack.com/howto/python/python-copy-to-clipboard/)
to do it, but if you don't want to add any other dependencies you can use
`subprocess run`.

To copy from the `selection` clipboard, assuming you've got `xclip` installed,
you could do:

```python
subprocess.run(
    ["xclip", "-selection", "clipboard", "-i"],
    input="text to be copied",
    text=True,
    check=True,
)
```

To paste it:

```python
subprocess.check_output(["xclip", "-o", "-selection", "clipboard"]).decode("utf-8")
```

# [Initialize a dataclass with kwargs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55099243/python3-dataclass-with-kwargsasterisk)

If you care about accessing attributes by name, or if you can't distinguish
between known and unknown arguments during initialisation, then your last resort
without rewriting `__init__` (which pretty much defeats the purpose of using
dataclasses in the first place) is writing a `@classmethod`:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from inspect import signature


@dataclass
class Container:
    user_id: int
    body: str

    @classmethod
    def from_kwargs(cls, **kwargs):

# [Define a property of a class](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/128573/using-property-on-classmethods/64738850#64738850)

If you're using Python 3.9 or above you can directly use the decorators:

```python
class G:
    @classmethod
    @property
    def __doc__(cls):
        return f"A doc for {cls.__name__!r}"
```

If you're not, you can define the decorator `classproperty`:

```python
# N801: class name 'classproperty' should use CapWords convention, but it's a decorator.
# C0103: Class name "classproperty" doesn't conform to PascalCase naming style but it's
# a decorator.
class classproperty:  # noqa: N801, C0103
    """Define a class property.

    From Python 3.9 you can directly use the decorators directly.

    class G:
        @classmethod
        @property
        def __doc__(cls):
            return f'A doc for {cls.__name__!r}'
    """

    def __init__(self, function: Callable[..., Any]) -> None:
        """Initialize the decorator."""
        self.function = function

    # ANN401: Any not allowed in typings, but I don't know how to narrow the hints in
    # this case.
    def __get__(self, owner_self: Any, owner_cls: Any) -> Any:  # noqa: ANN401
        """Return the desired value."""
        return self.function(owner_self)
```

But you'll run into the
`W0143: Comparing against a callable, did you omit the parenthesis? (comparison-with-callable)`
mypy error when using it to compare the result of the property with anything, as
it doesn't detect it's a property instead of a method.

duplicates = [number for number in numbers if numbers.count(number) > 1]
unique_duplicates = list(set(duplicates))

# Returns: [2, 3, 5]
```

If you want to count the number of occurrences of each duplicate, you can use:

```python
from collections import Counter

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 3, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 7]

counts = dict(Counter(numbers))
duplicates = {key: value for key, value in counts.items() if value > 1}

# Returns: {2: 2, 3: 4, 5: 3}
```

To remove the duplicates use a combination of `list` and `set`:

```python
unique = list(set(numbers))

# Returns: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

# [Change the working directory of a test](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62044541/change-pytest-working-directory-to-test-case-directory)

The following function-level fixture will change to the test case directory, run
the test (`yield`), then change back to the calling directory to avoid
side-effects.

```python
@pytest.fixture(name="change_test_dir")
def change_test_dir_(request: SubRequest) -> Any:
    os.chdir(request.fspath.dirname)
    yield
    os.chdir(request.config.invocation_dir)
```

- `request` is a built-in pytest fixture
- `fspath` is the `LocalPath` to the test module being executed
- `dirname` is the directory of the test module
- `request.config.invocationdir` is the folder from which pytest was executed
- `request.config.rootdir` is the pytest root, doesn't change based on where you
  run pytest. Not used here, but could be useful.

Any processes that are kicked off by the test will use the test case folder as
their working directory and copy their logs, outputs, etc. there, regardless of
where the test suite was executed.

# [Remove a substring from the end of a string](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1038824/how-do-i-remove-a-substring-from-the-end-of-a-string)

On Python 3.9 and newer you can use the `removeprefix` and `removesuffix`
methods to remove an entire substring from either side of the string:

```python
url = "abcdc.com"
url.removesuffix(".com")  # Returns 'abcdc'
url.removeprefix("abcdc.")  # Returns 'com'
```

On Python 3.8 and older you can use `endswith` and slicing:

```python
url = "abcdc.com"
if url.endswith(".com"):
    url = url[:-4]
```

Or a regular expression:

```python
import re

url = "abcdc.com"
url = re.sub("\.com$", "", url)
```

# Install default directories and files for a command line program

I've been trying for a long time to configure `setup.py` to run the required
steps to configure the required directories and files when doing `pip install`

Finally, I decided that the program itself should create the data once the
`FileNotFoundError` exception is found. That way, you don't penalize the load
time because if the file or directory exists, that code is not run.

# [Check if a dictionary is a subset of another](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9323749/how-to-check-if-one-dictionary-is-a-subset-of-another-larger-dictionary)

If you have two dictionaries `big = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c':3}` and
`small = {'c': 3, 'a': 1}`, and want to check whether `small` is a subset of
`big`, use the next snippet:

```python
>>> small.items() <= big.items()
True
```

As the code is not very common or intuitive, I'd add a comment to explain what
you're doing.

# [When to use `isinstance` and when to use `type`](https://towardsdatascience.com/difference-between-type-and-isinstance-in-python-47fae6fbb068)

`isinstance` takes into account inheritance, while `type` doesn't. So if we have
the next code:

```python
class Shape:
    pass


class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
        self.area = length * width

    def get_area(self):
        return self.length * self.width


class Square(Rectangle):
    def __init__(self, length):
        Rectangle.__init__(self, length, length)
```

And we want to check if an object `a = Square(5)` is of type `Rectangle`, we
could not use `isinstance` because it'll return `True` as it's a subclass of
`Rectangle`:

```python
>>> isinstance(a, Rectangle)
True
```

Instead, use a comparison with `type`:

```python
>>> type(a) == Rectangle
False
```

```python
from dateutil import parser

```

If you're using ambiguous date such as `03/05/24` and want the `3` to be the day and not the month use `parser.parse("03/05/24", dayfirst=True)`.

If you don't want to use `dateutil` use `datetime`

```python
datetime.datetime.strptime("2013-W26", "%Y-W%W-%w")
```

# Install a python dependency from a git repository

With
[pip you can](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16584552/how-to-state-in-requirements-txt-a-direct-github-source):

```bash
pip install git+git://github.com/path/to/repository@master
```

you need to:

```python
install_requires = [
    "some-pkg @ git+ssh://git@github.com/someorgname/pkg-repo-name@v1.1#egg=some-pkg",
]
```

But
[Pypi won't allow you to upload the package](https://github.com/BaderLab/saber/issues/35),
as it will give you an error:

```
HTTPError: 400 Bad Request from https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
Invalid value for requires_dist. Error: Can't have direct dependency: 'deepdiff @ git+git://github.com/lyz-code/deepdiff@master'
```

It looks like this is a conscious decision on the PyPI side. Basically, they
don't want pip to reach out to URLs outside their site when installing from
PyPI.

An ugly patch is to install the dependencies in a `PostInstall` custom script in
the `setup.py` of your program:

```python
from setuptools.command.install import install
from subprocess import getoutput

# ignore: cannot subclass install, has type Any. And what would you do?
class PostInstall(install):  # type: ignore
    """Install direct dependency.

    Pypi doesn't allow uploading packages with direct dependencies, so we need to
    install them manually.
    """

    def run(self) -> None:
        """Install dependencies."""
        install.run(self)
        print(getoutput("pip install git+git://github.com/lyz-code/deepdiff@master"))


setup(cmdclass={"install": PostInstall})
```

Warning: It may not work! Last time I used this solution, when I added the
library on a `setup.py` the direct dependencies weren't installed :S

# [Get the week number of a datetime](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2600775/how-to-get-week-number-in-python)

`datetime.datetime` has a `isocalendar()` method, which returns a tuple
containing the calendar week:

```python
>>> import datetime
>>> datetime.datetime(2010, 6, 16).isocalendar()[1]
24
```

`datetime.date.isocalendar()` is an instance-method returning a tuple containing
year, weeknumber and weekday in respective order for the given date instance.

# [Get the monday of a week number](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17087314/get-date-from-week-number)

A week number is not enough to generate a date; you need a day of the week as
well. Add a default:

```python
import datetime

d = "2013-W26"
r = datetime.datetime.strptime(d + "-1", "%Y-W%W-%w")
```

The `-1` and `-%w` pattern tells the parser to pick the Monday in that week.

# [Group or sort a list of dictionaries or objects by a specific key](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html)

Python lists have a built-in `list.sort()` method that modifies the list
in-place. There is also a `sorted()` built-in function that builds a new sorted
list from an iterable.

## [Sorting basics](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#sorting-basics)

A simple ascending sort is very easy: just call the `sorted()` function. It
returns a new sorted list:

```python
>>> sorted([5, 2, 3, 1, 4])
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## [Key functions](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#key-functions)

Both `list.sort()` and `sorted()` have a `key` parameter to specify a function
(or other callable) to be called on each list element prior to making
comparisons.

For example, here’s a case-insensitive string comparison:

```python
>>> sorted("This is a test string from Andrew".split(), key=str.lower)
['a', 'Andrew', 'from', 'is', 'string', 'test', 'This']
```

The value of the `key` parameter should be a function (or other callable) that
takes a single argument and returns a key to use for sorting purposes. This
technique is fast because the key function is called exactly once for each input
record.

A common pattern is to sort complex objects using some of the object’s indices
as keys. For example:

```python
>>> from operator import itemgetter
>>> student_tuples = [
    ('john', 'A', 15),
    ('jane', 'B', 12),
    ('dave', 'B', 10),
]

>>> sorted(student_tuples, key=itemgetter(2))   # sort by age
[('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]
```

The same technique works for objects with named attributes. For example:

```python
>>> from operator import attrgetter
>>> class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, grade, age):
        self.name = name
        self.grade = grade
        self.age = age

    def __repr__(self):
        return repr((self.name, self.grade, self.age))

>>> student_objects = [
    Student('john', 'A', 15),
    Student('jane', 'B', 12),
    Student('dave', 'B', 10),
]

>>> sorted(student_objects, key=attrgetter('age'))   # sort by age
[('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]
```

The operator module functions allow multiple levels of sorting. For example, to
sort by grade then by age:

```python
>>> sorted(student_tuples, key=itemgetter(1,2))
[('john', 'A', 15), ('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12)]

>>> sorted(student_objects, key=attrgetter('grade', 'age'))
[('john', 'A', 15), ('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12)]
```

## [Sorts stability and complex sorts](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#sort-stability-and-complex-sorts)

Sorts are guaranteed to be stable. That means that when multiple records have
the same key, their original order is preserved.

```python
>>> data = [('red', 1), ('blue', 1), ('red', 2), ('blue', 2)]

>>> sorted(data, key=itemgetter(0))
[('blue', 1), ('blue', 2), ('red', 1), ('red', 2)]
```

Notice how the two records for blue retain their original order so that
`('blue', 1)` is guaranteed to precede `('blue', 2)`.

This wonderful property lets you build complex sorts in a series of sorting
steps. For example, to sort the student data by descending grade and then
ascending age, do the age sort first and then sort again using grade:

```python
>>> s = sorted(student_objects, key=attrgetter('age'))     # sort on secondary key

>>> sorted(s, key=attrgetter('grade'), reverse=True)       # now sort on primary key, descending
[('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]
```

This can be abstracted out into a wrapper function that can take a list and
tuples of field and order to sort them on multiple passes.

```python
>>> def multisort(xs, specs):
    for key, reverse in reversed(specs):
        xs.sort(key=attrgetter(key), reverse=reverse)
    return xs

>>> multisort(list(student_objects), (('grade', True), ('age', False)))
[('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]
```

## [Get the attribute of an attribute](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/403421/how-to-sort-a-list-of-objects-based-on-an-attribute-of-the-objects)

To sort the list in place:

```python
ut.sort(key=lambda x: x.count, reverse=True)
```

To return a new list, use the `sorted()` built-in function:

```python
newlist = sorted(ut, key=lambda x: x.body.id_, reverse=True)
```

# Make multiline code look clean

If you need variables that contain multiline strings inside functions or methods
you need to remove the indentation

```python
def test():
    # end first line with \ to avoid the empty line!
    s = """\
hello
  world
"""
```

Which is inconvenient as it breaks some editor source code folding and it's ugly
for the eye.

The solution is to use
[`textwrap.dedent()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html)

```python
import textwrap


def test():
    # end first line with \ to avoid the empty line!
    s = """\
    hello
      world
    """
    print(repr(s))  # prints '    hello\n      world\n    '
    print(repr(textwrap.dedent(s)))  # prints 'hello\n  world\n'
```

If you forget to add the trailing `\` character of `s = '''\` or use
`s = '''hello`, you're going to have a bad time with [black](black.md).

a `break` statement.

## [Create user defined exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#user-defined-exceptions)

Programs may name their own exceptions by creating a new exception class.
Exceptions should typically be derived from the `Exception` class, either
directly or indirectly.

Exception classes are meant to be kept simple, only offering a number of
attributes that allow information about the error to be extracted by handlers
for the exception. When creating a module that can raise several distinct
errors, a common practice is to create a base class for exceptions defined by
that module, and subclass that to create specific exception classes for
different error conditions:

```python
class Error(Exception):
    """Base class for exceptions in this module."""


class ConceptNotFoundError(Error):
    """Transactions with unmatched concept."""

    def __init__(self, message: str, transactions: List[Transaction]) -> None:
        """Initialize the exception."""
        self.message = message
        self.transactions = transactions
        super().__init__(self.message)
```

Most exceptions are defined with names that end in “Error”, similar to the
naming of the standard exceptions.

## [Import a module or it's objects from within a python program](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html)

```python
import importlib

module = importlib.import_module("os")
module_class = module.getcwd

relative_module = importlib.import_module(".model", package="mypackage")
class_to_extract = "MyModel"
extracted_class = geattr(relative_module, class_to_extract)
```

The first argument specifies what module to import in absolute or relative terms
(e.g. either `pkg.mod` or `..mod`). If the name is specified in relative terms,
then the package argument must be set to the name of the package which is to act
as the anchor for resolving the package name (e.g.
`import_module('..mod', 'pkg.subpkg')` will `import pkg.mod`).
