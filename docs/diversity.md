[Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) can be defined
as](https://pulitzercenter.org/diversity-equity-and-inclusion):

* *Diversity* is the representation and acknowledgement of the multitudes of
    identities, experiences, and ways of moving through the world. This
    includes—but is not limited to—ability, age, citizenship status, criminal
    record and/or incarceration, educational attainment, ethnicity, gender,
    geographical location, language, nationality, political affiliation,
    religion, race, sexuality, socioeconomic status, and veteran status.
    Further, we recognize that each individual's experience is informed by
    intersections across multiple identities.

* *Equity*  seeks to ensure respect and equal opportunity for all, using all
    resources and tools to elevate the voices of under-represented and/or
    disadvantaged groups.

* *Inclusion* is fostering an environment in which people of all identities are
    welcome, valued, and supported. An inclusive organization solicits, listens
    to, learns from, and acts on the contributions of all its stakeholders.
