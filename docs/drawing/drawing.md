It's really difficult to choose where to start if you want to learn how to draw
from scratch as there are too many resources. I'm starting with
[Drawabox](https://drawabox.com), a free course based on series of practical
exercises to teach the basics. I'd probably go to
[Ctrl+Paint](https://www.ctrlpaint.com/) once I'm done.

# The basics

## [Changing the mindset](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/2/ready)

Start your drawing path with the following guidelines to make your progression smoother:

* Focus on the experience of drawing instead of the result.
* Understand that doing something badly does not define who you are. So tackle
    the *I can't draw that* feeling with *I can't draw that well*. If
    you're afraid the thing you want to draw is out of your reach, draw it
    anyway.
* [At least half of the time](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/2/50percent) spent
    drawing must be devoted to drawing purely for its own sake. If you don't
    have much time, alternate the purpose of your sessions.
* [Don't over control your hand with your
    brain](https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/1/mechanical) to try to be absolutely
    precise and accurate. Doing so will result in numerous course corrections
    making your strokes wobbly, stiff and erratic. Furthermore, spending all
    the focus resources in precision, will result in a lack to solve the other
    problems involved. Once *muscle memory* is gained, the strokes will be
    cleaner.
* [Draw exactly what you see, while you see
    it](https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/1/analytical). Don't trust you memory, as
    it will simplify things without you noticing it.
* [Draw from your shoulder](https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/3/pivots).  We are
    used to pivot on the wrist as it makes stiff and accurate linework, suitable
    for writing. But falls apart when making smooth and consistent strokes.

    So use the wrist when drawing stiff but precise marks in areas of detail or
    texture. There are plenty of cases where the elbow will work fine, but using
    it will get you in the habit of taking [the path of least
    resistance](https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/3/leastresistance). So try to use
    the shoulder.

    This means driving the motion from the muscles that control that joint. As
    it has a considerable range of motion, you should be able to move your arm
    with minimal adjustment from your elbow.

    If you catch yourself having fallen back to drawing from the elbow, do the
    following exercise: Draw pivoting from your wrist while locking the rest of
    the joints, to get used to what that feels like. Then lock it and move to
    the elbow. Finally lock the elbow and go for the shoulder.


Drawing at it's simplest level is the act of putting marks on a page in order or
communicate or convey something. Marks should:

* [Flow continuously](https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/2/continuous): When making
    a line between two points, do it with a single continuous stroke even if you
    miss the end.

    ![ ](draw-a-box-flow-continuous.jpg)

* [Flow smoothly](https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/2/smooth): Draw with a confident
    and persistent pace (enough to keep your brain from interfering and
    attempting to course correct as you go). Again we [favor flow over
    accuracy](https://drawabox.com/comic/1), so expect to make your lines less
    accurate.

    ![ ](draw-a-box-flow-smooth.jpg)

* [Maintain a consistent
    trayectory](https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/2/consistent): Split lines
    into derivable strokes. Otherwise, you'll make mindless zigzags.

## Drawing skills

The course focuses on [these psychological skills and
concepts](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/3):

* *Confidence*: The willingness to push forwards without hesitation once your
    preparations are complete.
* *Control*: The ability to decide ahead of time what kind of mark you wish to
    puto down on the page, and to execute as intended.
* *Patience*: The path is hard.
* *Spatial Reasoning*: To be able to understand the things we draw as being
    three dimensional forms that exist in and relate to one another within
    the three dimensional world.
* *Construction*: The ability to look at a complex object and break it down into
    simple components that can be drawn individually and combined to reconstruct
    our complex object on a page.
* *Visual Communication*: The ability to take a concept, idea, or amount of
    information, and to convey it clearly and directly to an audience using
    visual means.

## [Ghosting](https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/ghostedlines)

Ghosting lines is a technique to break the mark making process into a series of
steps that allows us to draw with confidence while also improving the accuracy
of our results. It also forces us to think and consider our intentions before
*each and every mark* we put down.

* [*Planning*](https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/9/planning): Lay out the terms of
    the line you want to draw, paint a dot for the start and another for the
    end.

    ![ ](draw-a-box-flow-ghosting-planning.jpg)

* [*Rotating the page*](https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/9/rotating): Find the most
    comfortable angle of approach for the line you've planned. Usually it's
    roughly a 45 degree angle fom left to right (if you're right handed).

    ![ ](draw-a-box-flow-ghosting-rotate.jpg)

* [*Ghosting*](https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/9/ghosting): Go through the motion
    of drawing your line, over and over, in one direction, without actually
    touching the page, so as to build muscle memory.

    ![ ](draw-a-box-flow-ghosting-ghosting.jpg)

* [*Execution*](https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/9/execution): Once you feel
    comfortable with the motion, without missing a beat or breaking the rhythm
    of repetition, lower your pen to the page and go through the motion *one* more
    time.

# Drawabox course guidelines

When doing the course exercises, try to:

* Read only the instruction pages that are assigned to each exercise.
* Don't redo the exercises until you achieve perfection, even when you don't
    feel satisfied with your results. Accept this now, and it will save you
    a lot of grief and wasted time in the future.
* Your only focus should be on following the instructions to the best of your
    current ability. Read and follow the instructions carefully to ensure you
    understand them.
* Each time you finish an exercise incorporate into a pool from which take two
    or three at the beginning of each session to do for 10 or 15 minutes.

## [Tools to use](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/5)

For the Drawabox course, you need a *fineliner*, also called *felt tips* or
*technical pens*. The author recommends Staedtler Pigments Liners and Faber
Castell PITT Artist Pens (their sizing is different, F is the equivalent to
0.5).

When using it, make sure you're not applying too much pressure, as it will
damage the tip and reduce the flow of ink.

For the paper, use the regular printer one.

## Basic Shapes

### [Ellipses](https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/5/video)

Ellipses are the next basic shape we're going to study (after the lines). They
are extremely important and notoriously annoying to draw. Important because
we're going to be using ellipses in 2D space to represent circles that exist in
3D space.

How our circle (in 3D space) is rotated relative to the viewer will determine
how wide our ellipse is going to be drawn. The degree shift (or angle) is
measured between the minor axis and the line joining the viewer to the center of
the circle. It will therefore be 90 degrees when it's facing directly to us, and
0 when we only see a line.

![ ](draw-a-box-ellipses-degree-shift.jpg)

Keep in mind that the degree shift will change if we move the circle around even
if we don't rotate it.

![ ](draw-a-box-ellipses-moving.jpg)

The minor axis is the line that passes across the ellipse's narrowest span and
through it's center. This axis will split the ellipse into two equal symmetrical
halves. An interesting property of the minor axis is that it coincides with and
aligns with the normal vector of the circle.

This means that we've got two ways of establishing the orientation of our circle
in 3D space, as we draw it on our 2D page.

* The degree (width) of the ellipse controlling the circle's rotation
* The minor axis of the ellipse controlling the orientation of the circle's
    normal vector.

If we need our circle to be oriented in a specific way in a more complicated
scene, we will actually be able to start out with a normal vector line, then use
it as the minor axis for our ellipse.

Taking it further, the minor axis can be used to build cylindrical forms because any
section of a cylinder shares the same normal vector.

#### Drawing ellipses

To draw ellipses follow the next steps:

* Decide on the ellipse degree, position and boundaries.
* Ghost the ellipse
* Draw around the ellipse two or three times before lifting your pen.

    When you try to hit your ellipse in a single round, it's usually going to
    come out uneven and wobbly (due to drawing too slowly and carefully) or
    extremely loose (due to simply not having built up the muscle memory to nail
    an ellipse). Drawing through your ellipses gives your arm the chance to
    familiarize itself with what's being asked of it in that first pass, and
    then firm it up in the second. It also helps you maintain the confidence
    needed to achieve a smooth, even shape, without totally losing control.

skills.
