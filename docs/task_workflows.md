# Hype flow versus a defined plan

I've found two ways to work on my tasks: following a plan and following the hype
flow.

The first one helps you finish what you started, and directs your efforts
towards big goals. The side effect is that it achieves it by setting constrains
on what to do, so you sometimes end up in the position of doing tasks that you
don't want to at the moment, and suppressing yourself not to do the ones that
you want.

The second one takes advantage of letting you work on wherever you want at the
moment, which boosts your creativity and productivity. This way imposes less
constrains on you and is more pleasant because surfing the hype is awesome. The
side effect is that if you have many interests, you can move forward very
quickly on many directions leaving a lot of projects half done, instead of
pushing in the direction of your big goals.

The art here is to combine both at need, if you have a good plan, you may be
able to start surfing the hype, and when the time constrains start to press you,
switch to a stricter plan to be able to deliver value in time. This makes more
sense in work environments, at personal level I usually just surf the hype
unless I have a clear objective with a due date to reach.

# Planning workflows

Task management can be done at different levels. All of them help you in
different ways to reduce the mental load, each also gives you extra benefits
that can't be gained by the others. Going from lowest to highest abstraction
level we have:

* Task plan.
* Pomodoro.
* Day plan.
* Week plan.
* Fortnight plan.
* Month plan.
* Trimester plan.
* Year plan.

If you're starting your task management career, start with the first level. Once
you're comfortable, move one step up until you reach the sweet spot between time
invested in management and the profit it returns.

Each of the plans defined below describe the most complete process, use them as
a starting point to define the plan that works for you depending on your needs
and how much time you want to invest at that particular moment. Even I don't
follow them strictly. As they change over time, it's useful to find a way to be
able to follow them without thinking too much on what are the specific steps,
for example having a checklist or a script.

## Task plan

The task plan defines the steps required to finish a task. It's your most basic
roadmap to address a task, and a good starting point if you feel
overwhelmed when faced with an assignment.

When done well, you'll better understand what you need to do, it will prevent
you from wasting time at dead ends as you'll think before acting, and you'll
develop the invaluable skill of breaking big problems into smaller ones.

To define a task plan, follow the next steps:

* Decide what do you want to achieve when the task is finished.
* Analyze the possible ways to arrive to that goal. Try to assess different
    solutions before choosing one.
* Once you have it, split it into steps small enough to be comfortable
    following them without further analysis.

Some people define the task plan whenever they add the task to their task
manager. Others prefer to save some time each month to refine the plans of the
tasks to be done the next one.

The plan is an alive document that changes each [Pomodoro cycle](#pomodoro) and
that you'll need to check often. It has to be accessible and it should be easy
for you to edit. If you don't know where to start, use the [simplest task
manager](task_tools.md#divide-a-task-in-small-steps).

Try not to overplan though, if at the middle of a task you realize that the rest
of the steps don't make sense, all the time invested in their definition will be
lost. That's why it's a good idea to have a great detail for the first steps and
gradually move to rougher definitions on later ones.

## Pomodoro

Pomodoro is a technique used to ensure that for short periods of time, you invest
all your mental resources in doing the work needed to finish a task. It's your
main unit of work and a good starting point if you have concentration issues.

When done well, you'll start moving faster on your tasks, because [uninterrupted
work](interruption_management.md) is the most efficient. You'll also begin to
know if you're drifting from your [day's plan](#day-plan), and will have space to
adapt it or the [task plan](#task-plan) to time constrains or unexpected events.

!!! note ""
    If you don't yet have a [task plan](#task-plan) or [day plan](#day-plan),
    don't worry! Ignore the steps that involve them until you do.

The next steps define a Pomodoro cycle:

* Select the cycle time span. Either 20 minutes or until the next interruption,
    whichever is shortest.
* Decide what are you going to do.
* Analyze yourself to see if you're state of mind is ready to only do that for
    the chosen time span. If it's not, maybe you need to take a "Pomodoro
    break", take 20 minutes off doing something that replenish your willpower or
    the personal attribute that is preventing you to be able to work.
* Start the timer.
* Work uninterruptedly on what you've decided until the timer goes off.
* Take 20s to look away from the screen (this is good for your ejes).
* Update your [task](#task-plan) and [day](#day-plan) plans:
    * Tick off the done task steps.
    * Refine the task steps that can be addressed in the next cycle.
    * Check if you can still meet the day's plan.
* Check the [interruption channels that need to be checked each 20
    minutes](interruption_management.md#define-your-interruption-events).

At the fourth Pomodoro cycle, you'll have finished a Pomodoro iteration. At the
end of the iteration:

* Check if you're going to meet the [day plan](#day), if you're not, change
    change it or the [task plan](#task) to make the time constrain.
* Get a small rest, you've earned it! Get off the chair, stretch or give a small
    walk. What's important is that you take your mind off the task at hand and
    let your body rest. Remember, this is a marathon, you need to take care of
    yourself.
* Start a new Pomodoro iteration.

If you're super focused at the end of a Pomodoro cycle, you can skip the task
plan update until the end of the iteration.

To make it easy to follow the pomodoro plan I use a script that:

* Uses [timer](https://github.com/pando85/timer) to show the countdown.
* Uses [safeeyes](https://github.com/slgobinath/SafeEyes) to track the eye rests.
* Asks me to follow the list of steps I've previously defined.

## Day plan

This plan defines at day level which tasks are you going to work on and
schedules when are you going to address them. It's the most basic roadmap to
address a group of tasks. The goal is to survive the day. It's a good starting
point if you forget to do tasks that need to be done in the day or if you miss
appointments.

It's also the next step of advance awareness, if you have a day plan, on each
[Pomodoro](#pomodoro) iteration you'll get the feeling whether you're going to
finish what you proposed yourself.

You can make your plan at the start of the day, start by getting an idea of:

* What do you need to do by checking:
    * The last day's plan.
    * Calendar events.
    * The [week's plan](#week-plan) if you have it, or the prioritized list of
        tasks to do.
* How much uninterrupted time you have between calendar events.
* Your state of mind.

Then create the day schedule:

* Add the calendar events.
* Add the [interruption
    events](interruption_management.md#define-your-interruption-events).
* Setup an alert for the closest calendar event.

And the day tasks plan:

* Decide the tasks to be worked on and think when you want to do them.

To follow it throughout the day and when it's coming to an end:

* Update your [week](#week-plan) or/and [task](#task-plan) plans to meet the time
    constrains.
* Optionally sketch the next day's plan.

When doing the plan keep in mind to minimize the number of tasks and calendar
events so as not to get overwhelmed, and not to schedule a new task before you
finish what you've already started. It's better to eventually fall short on
tasks, than never reaching your goal.

To make it easy to follow I use a script that:

* Asks me to check the weather forecast.
* Uses [timer](https://github.com/pando85/timer) to show the countdown.
* Uses [safeeyes](https://github.com/slgobinath/SafeEyes) to track the eye rests.
* Asks me to follow the list of steps I've previously defined.

## Week plan

The plan defines at week level which tasks are you going to work on and
schedules when are you going to address them. It's the next roadmap level to
address a group of tasks. The goal changes from surviving the day to start
planning your life. It's a good starting point if you are comfortable working
with the pomodoro, task and day plans, and want to start deciding where you're
heading to.

It's also the next step of advance awareness, if you have a week plan, each
day you'll get the feeling whether you're going to finish what you proposed
yourself.

You can make your plan at the start of the week, similar to the [day
plan](#day-plan), start by getting an idea of:

* What do you need to do by:
    * Closing the last week's plan.
    * Checking upcoming calendar events.
    * The month's plan if you have it, or the prioritized list of
        tasks to do, identifying the task dependencies that may block the task
        development.
* How much uninterrupted time you have between calendar events.
* Your state of mind.

To close the last week's plan:

* Mark the plan items as done
* Get an idea of what percent of objectives you actually met. With the mindset
    of seeing how much you can commit on the next one, not to think how bad you
    performed, you did the best you could, and nothing else could be done.
* Clean the active tasks. Throughout the week, there will be tasks that you left
    unfinished. For each of them:

    * Decide if the task still makes sense and if it's actionable
    * Check if you can merge it with other tasks
    * Check if it belongs to an active objective
    * Remove the rest.

Then create the week schedule:

* Arrange or move calendar events to maximize the uninterrupted periods, then
    add them to the plan.
* Add the [interruption
    events](interruption_management.md#define-your-interruption-events).
* Decide the tasks to be worked on and roughly assign them to the week days.

Follow it throughout the week, and when it's coming to an end:

* Update your month or/and [task](#task-plan) plans to meet the time
    constrains.
* Update the people that may depend on you of possible plan drifts.

To make it easy to follow I use a script that:

* Asks me to follow the list of steps I've previously defined.

## Fortnight, month, trimester plan

From the [week plan](#week-plan) you can increasingly think your roadmap, start
with a fortnight plan, when you're comfortable go up to month and trimester
plans. The idea is similar to the week plan but with less definition. You deal
with bigger tasks that help shape your life in the long run.

The process of planning and reviewing each of these should be as short as
possible, otherwise you'll soon get tired of it. For example, for the month plan you can:

* Do the week plan review: Where you transfer the non planned tasks to the
    month plan.
* Do the fortnight plan review
* Do the month plan review:
    * Check the objectives you had and how many you meet, adding notes on your
        progress.
    * Analyze what to do with the new objectives, adding them to the trimester plan
    * Transfer the non planned elements to the semester plan.
* Do the month's planning:
    * Review the semester plan if you have it.
    * Decide which big tasks you want to work on
* Do the fortnight plan
* Do the week plan
