# Meta

## [Wish list](projects.md)

* New: Feature mkdocs-rss-plugin as a solution of publishing mkdocs updates as an RSS.

# [Activism](anonymous_feedback.md)

* New: Introduce the anonymous feedback tool to improve diversity, equity and inclusion in an organization.

    Anonymous Feedback is a communication tool where people share feedback
    to
    teammates or other organizational members while protecting their identities.
    
    Until the safe space is built where direct feedback is viable, anonymous
    feedback gives these employees a mechanism to raise their concerns, practice
    their
    feedback-giving skills, test the waters, and understand how people perceive
    their constructive (and sometimes critical) opinions, thus building the
    needed
    trust.

### [Build your own Digital Garden](build_your_own_wiki.md)

    plugin.
