* Improvement: [Add mkdocs-newsletter as a dormant plant.](projects.md#mkdocs-newsletter)

    MkDocs plugin to show the changes of documentation repositories in
    a user friendly format, at the same time that it's easy for the authors
    to maintain.
    
    It creates daily, weekly, monthly and yearly newsletter articles with
    the changes of each period. Those pages, stored under the `Newsletters`
    section, are filled with the changes extracted from the commit messages
    of the git history.  The changes are grouped by categories,
    subcategories and then by file using the order of the site's navigation
    structure. RSS feeds are also created for each newsletter type, so it's
    easy for people to keep updated with the evolution of the site.

* Reorganization: Update and reorganize projects.
