# [Projects](projects.md)

* Improvement: Explain the updates on the repository-orm project.

    In the latest version `0.2.0`, we added:

    * Support for the [TinyDB repository](https://lyz-code.github.io/repository-orm/tinydb_repository/).
    * Support for regular expressions in the `search` method.
    * Easier repository loading with `load_repository` function.

* Improvement: Add a link to the meilisearch [blog](https://blog.meilisearch.com/).
* New: Create the quantified self project.

    With links to the two starting points [HPI](https://beepb00p.xyz/hpi.html) and [bionic](https://github.com/bionic-dev/bionic).


* New: [Sketch how to automate repetitive tasks prompted by email events.](projects.md#automate-email-management)

    Most of the emails I receive require repetitive actions that can be automated,
    I've stumbled upon [notmuchmail](https://notmuchmail.org/), which looks very
    promising. A friend suggested to use
    [afew](https://afew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for tagging, and I'd probably use
    [alot](https://github.com/pazz/alot) to interact with the system (and finally be
    able to use email from the cli).

* Improvement: [Add interesting interface.](projects.md#quantified-self)

    For the interface [adri's memex](https://github.com/adri/memex) looks awesome!
    It's inspired in the Andrew Louis [talk Building
    a Memex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFWxvQn4cf8&t=1616s) whose [blog
    posts](https://hyfen.net/memex/) seems to be a gold mine.

    Also look at [hpi's compilation](https://github.com/hpi/hpi).

* New: [Sketch how to improve the launching of applications with i3wm.](projects.md#improve-the-way-of-launching-applications-with-i3wm)

    In the past I tried installing [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
    without success, I should try again. If the default features are not enough,
    check [adi1090x's custom resources](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi).

* Improvement: [Show the changes of repository-orm 0.3.1.](projects.md#repository-orm)

    +* Add `first` and `last` methods to the repositories.
    +* Make entity `id_` definition optional.
    +* add `_model_name` attribute to entities.

* Improvement: [Add woop awesome quantified self resources to the research list.](projects.md#quantified-self)
* New: [Add project to migrate software bug tracker to a vendor free one like `git-bug`.](projects.md#migrate-software-bug-tracker-to-a-vendor-free-one)
* New: [Improve the notification management in Linux.](projects.md#improve-the-notification-management-in-linux)

    Create new seed project to be able to group and silence the notifications under a custom logic.
    For example:

    * If I want to focus on a task, only show the most important ones.
    * Only show alerts once every X minutes. Or define that I want to receive them
        the first 10 minutes of every hour.
    * If I'm not working, silence all work alerts.

* New: [Improve the hard drive monitor system.](projects.md#improve-the-hard-drive-monitor-system)

    Create new seed project to use something like [scrutiny](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny) (there's a [linuxserver image](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-scrutiny)) to collect and display the information. For alerts, use one of their [supported providers](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny#notifications).

* New: [Aggregate all notifications.](projects.md#aggregate-all-notifications)

    Instead of reading the email, github, gitlab, discourse, reddit notifications,
    aggregate all in one place and show them to the user in a nice command line
    interface.

    For the aggregator server, my first choice would be [gotify](https://gotify.net/).

* New: [Add faker-optional to the dormant plant projects.](projects.md#faker-optional)
* New: [Add seedling project to create factoryboy factories from pydantic models automatically.](projects.md#other)

# DevOps

## Continuous Integration

### [Flakehell](flakeheaven.md)

* Correction: Update the git repository.

    The existent repository has been archived in favor of [this one](https://github.com/flakeheaven/flakeheaven)

* New: Explain how to patch the extended_default_ignore error for versions > 3.9.0.

    Add to your your `pyproject.toml`:

    ```ini
    [tool.flakeheaven]
    extended_default_ignore=[]  # add this
    ```

# Coding

## [Python](python.md)

* Improvement: Add aiomultiprocess to the list of libraries to test.

    [aiomultiprocess](https://github.com/omnilib/aiomultiprocess): Presents
    a simple interface, while running a full AsyncIO event loop on each
    child process, enabling levels of concurrency never before seen in
    a Python application. Each child process can execute multiple coroutines
    at once, limited only by the workload and number of cores available.


* New: [Add interesting links on how to write good documentation.](python.md#how-to-write-good-documentation)

    I would like to refactor
    [divio's](https://documentation.divio.com/introduction/) and
    [Vue's](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/contributing/writing-guide.html#principles)
    guidelines and apply it to my projects.

* Improvement: Add FastAPI docs as a model to study and follow.
* New: Add apprise to the interesting libraries to explore.

    [apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise): Allows you to send
    a notification to almost all of the most popular notification services
    available to us today such as: Linux, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Amazon
    SNS, Gotify, etc. Look at [all the supported notifications](https://github.com/caronc/apprise#supported-notifications)
    `(¬º-°)¬`.


* New: Add kivi and kivimd to the interesting libraries to explore.

    [kivi](https://kivy.org/) is used to create android/Linux/iOS/Windows applications with python. Use it with [kivimd](https://github.com/kivymd/KivyMD) to make it beautiful, check [the examples](https://github.com/HeaTTheatR/Articles) and the [docs](https://kivymd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


### [Boto3](boto3.md)

* New: Introduce the AWS SDK library and explain how to test it.

    [Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) is
    the AWS SDK for Python to create, configure, and manage AWS services,
    such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage
    Service (Amazon S3). The SDK provides an object-oriented API as well as
    low-level access to AWS services.

    For [testing](boto3.md#testing), try to use [moto](boto3.md#moto), using the [Botocore's stubber](https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/stubber.html) as fallback option.

* New: Explain how to test ec2, route53, s3, and rds resources.
* New: Explain how to test vpc and auto scaling group resources.
* Improvement: Explain how to extract the instance when testing autoscaling groups.

    Also track the [issue to add support to launch templates](boto3.md#issues).

* New: [Explain how to test security groups.](boto3.md#test-security-groups)
* Correction: [Add note that pagination is not yet supported when testing route53.](boto3.md#test-route53)

    I've [opened an issue](https://github.com/spulec/moto/issues/3879) to
    solve it.


### [Type Hints](type_hints.md)

* Improvement: Explain how to ignore a linter error and a type error.

    With `# type: ignore # noqa: W0212`

### [Logging](python_logging.md)

* New: Explain how to log python program exceptions better than to a file.

    Using `logging` to write write exceptions and breadcrumbs to a file
    might not be the best solution because unless you look at it directly
    most errors will pass unnoticed.

    To actively monitor and react to code exceptions use an application monitoring
    platform like [sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/).

    In the article I explain what are the advantages of using this solution
    and do a comparison between Sentry and [GlitchTip](https://glitchtip.com).

### [DeepDiff](deepdiff.md)

* Improvement: Add warning that regular expressions are not yet supported.

    Until [#239](https://github.com/seperman/deepdiff/pull/239) is merged, the
    official library doesn't support searching for regular expressions. You can
    use [my fork](https://github.com/lyz-code/deepdiff) instead.

* Improvement: Remove advice to use my fork instead.

    The original one has already merged my [PR](https://github.com/seperman/deepdiff/pull/239) `＼\ ٩( ᐛ )و /／`. Beware though as the `regexp` are not enabled by default (against my will). You need to use the `use_regexp=True` as an argument to `grep` or `DeepSearch`.

### [FactoryBoy](factoryboy.md)

* New: [Explain how to use `Enum` with factoryboy.](factoryboy.md#word-from-enum-choices)

### [Faker](faker.md)

* New: [Explain how to create `Optional` data.](faker.md#create-optional-data)

    [`faker-optional`](https://lyz-code.github.io/faker-optional/) is
    a custom faker provider that acts as a wrapper over other Faker providers to return their value or `None`. Useful to
    create data of type `Optional[Any]`.

### [FastAPI](python_plugin_system.md)

* New: Add beets system as a first approach.

    When building Python applications, it's good to develop the core of your
    program, and allow extension via plugins.

    I still don't know how to do it, but [Beets plugin system](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dev/plugins.html)
    looks awesome for a first start.


* New: Introduce FastAPI the pydantic friendly python framework to build APIs.

    [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a modern, fast (high-performance),
    web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type
    hints.


* New: Sum up the basic documentation.

    Explain how to:

    * [Sending data to the server](fastapi.md#sending-data-to-the-server):
        Through [path parameters](fastapi.md#path-parameters), [query parameters](fastapi.md#query-parameters) and [body requests](fastapi.md#body-requests).
    * [Handle errors](fastapi.md#handling-errors).
    * [Update data](fastapi.md#updating-data)
    * [Configure OpenAPI](fastapi.md#openapi-configuration)
    * [Test FastAPI applications](fastapi.md#testing)

    And add a lot of [more interesting features](fastapi.md#interesting-features-to-explore) I've discovered.


* New: [Explain how to log exceptions to sentry.](fastapi.md#logging-to-sentry)
* New: [Explain how to send raw data to the client.](fastapi.md#sending-data-to-the-client)

    With the [`Response`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-directly/#returning-a-custom-response) object.

* New: [Explain how to configure the application.](fastapi.md#configuration)
* New: [Explain how to inject a testing configuration in the tests.](fastapi.md#inject-testing-configuration)

### [Pytest](pytest.md)

* New: [Explain how to exclude code from the coverage report.](pytest.md#excluding-code-from-coverage)

    Add `# pragma: no cover`.

* New: [Explain how to run tests in parallel.](pytest.md#running-tests-in-parallel)

    `pytest-xdist` makes it possible to run the tests in parallel, useful when the
    test suit is large or when the tests are slow.

    ```bash
    pip install pytest-xdist
    pytest -n auto
    ```

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: [Explain how to install dependencies from git repositories.](python_snippets.md#install-a-python-dependency-from-a-git-repository)

    With [pip you can](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16584552/how-to-state-in-requirements-txt-a-direct-github-source):

    ```bash
    pip install git+git://github.com/path/to/repository@master
    ```

    If you want [to hard code it in your `setup.py`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32688688/how-to-write-setup-py-to-include-a-git-repository-as-a-dependency/54794506#54794506), you need to:

    ```python
    install_requires = [
      'some-pkg @ git+ssh://git@github.com/someorgname/pkg-repo-name@v1.1#egg=some-pkg',
    ]
    ```

* Correction: Explain how to create PyPI valid packages with direct dependencies.

    It looks like PyPI don't want pip to reach out to URLs outside their
    site when installing from PyPI. So you can't define the direct
    dependencies in the `install_requires`. Instead you need to install them
    in a `PostInstall` custom script. Ugly as hell.

* Correction: [Add warning about the method to use direct dependencies.](python_snippets.md#install-a-python-dependency-from-a-git-repository)

    Last time I used this solution, when I added the library on a `setup.py`
    the direct dependencies weren't installed :S

### [NetworkX](networkx.md)

* New: Introduce the python library.

    [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) is a Python package for the creation,
    manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex
    networks.

### [Pydantic](pydantic.md)

* Improvement: Change parse_obj definition to find how to import pydantic models from dictionary.
* New: [Explain how to use private attributes.](pydantic.md#set-private-attributes)

    With the [`PrivateAttr`](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/#private-model-attributes) object.

* New: [Explain how to update entity attributes with a dictionary.](pydantic.md#update-entity-attributes-with-a-dictionary)

    You can create a new object with the new data using the `update`
    argument of the `copy` entity method.

### [rich](rich.md)

* New: Introduce the python cli builder library and it's progress bar.

    [Rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) is a Python library for rich text
    and beautiful formatting in the terminal.

    Check out the beautiful progress bar:

    ```bash
    pip install rich
    python -m rich.progress
    ```


### [Ruamel YAML](ruamel_yaml.md)

* Improvement: Suggest to use ruyaml instead of ruamel.yaml.

    As it's maintained by the community and versioned with git.

### [sqlite3](sqlite3.md)

* New: [Explain how to implement the REGEXP operator with Python.](sqlite3.md#regexp)

### [TinyDB](tinydb.md)

* New: [Explain how to serialize datetime objects.](tinydb.md#serializing-custom-data)

## [SQLite](sqlite.md)

* New: [Explain how to configure sqlite to be able to use the REGEXP operator.](sqlite.md#regexp)

    It's not enabled by default.

# Operative Systems

## Linux

### [Beets](vim_plugins.md)

* Correction: Typo.

    There was a missing comma in the list.

* New: Introduce Beets the music management library.

    [Beets](https://beets.io/) is a music management library used to get your music
    collection right once and for all. It catalogs your collection, automatically
    improving its metadata as it goes using the MusicBrainz database. Then it
    provides a set of tools for manipulating and accessing your music.

### [HAProxy](haproxy.md)

* New: Add interesting guidelines on [how to configure HAProxy in AWS](https://github.com/jvehent/haproxy-aws).

### [Hushboard](husboard.md)

* New: Introduce Husboard.

    [Hushboard](https://kryogenix.org/code/hushboard/) is an utility that mutes your microphone while you’re typing.

    (Thanks [M0wer](https://m0wer.github.io/memento/computer_science/gnu_linux/hushboard/)!)


### [ffmpeg](ffmpeg.md)

* New: Introduce the program and multiple of it's uses.

    [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) is a complete, cross-platform solution
    to record, convert and stream audio and video.


### [Mopidy](mopidy.md)

* New: Introduce the music server.

    [Mopidy](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy) is an extensible music server written
    in Python, that plays perfectly with [beets](beets.md) and the MPD
    ecosystem.

    The awesome documentation, being Python based, the extension system,
    JSON-RPC, and JavaScript APIs make Mopidy a perfect base for your
    projects.

# Arts

## [Writing](writing.md)

* New: [Explain when to use I'm good or I'm well.](writing.md#im-good-or-im-well)

    Use I'm well when referring to being ill, use I'm good for the rest.


### [Grammar and Orthography](orthography.md)

* New: Explain when to write won't or wont.

    * Won't is the correct way to contract will not.
    * Wont is a synonym of "a habit". For example, "He went for a morning jog, as was his wont".


# Other

* Correction: Broken links.

    Removed the link to (everything_i_know.md) since it no longer exists. Updated some links that where broken due to a folder structure change.

* New: Explain how to select a random choice from `Enum` objects.

    [pydantic](pydantic.md) uses `Enum` objects to define [the choices of
    fields](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/types/#enums-and-choices), so
    we need them to create the factories of those objects.

* New: Improve the periodic tasks and application metrics monitoring.

    Setup an [healthchecks](https://healthchecks.io/) instance with the [linuxserver image](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-healthchecks) to monitor cronjobs.

    For the notifications either use the [prometheus metrics](https://healthchecks.io/docs/configuring_prometheus/) or an [apprise](https://github.com/healthchecks/healthchecks/issues/271) compatible system.
