* New: Introduce cruft tool to manage cookiecutter templates.

    [cruft](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/) allows you to maintain all the
    necessary boilerplate for packaging and building projects separate from the code
    you intentionally write. Fully compatible with existing
    [Cookiecutter](cookiecutter.md) templates.
    

* Improvement: Add references on why is not easy to update cookiecutter templates.
* Reorganization: Split CI documents into their own pages.
* New: Introduce flakehell python linter.

    Flakehell is a [Flake8](flake8.md) wrapper to make it cool.
    

* Correction: Explain how to remove all pip packages from a virtualenv.
