# [Projects](projects.md)

* Improvement: [Add woop awesome quantified self resources to the research list.](projects.md#quantified-self)
* New: [Add project to migrate software bug tracker to a vendor free one like `git-bug`.](projects.md#migrate-software-bug-tracker-to-a-vendor-free-one)
* New: [Improve the notification management in Linux.](projects.md#improve-the-notification-management-in-linux)

    Create new seed project to be able to group and silence the notifications under a custom logic.
    For example:

    * If I want to focus on a task, only show the most important ones.
    * Only show alerts once every X minutes. Or define that I want to receive them
        the first 10 minutes of every hour.
    * If I'm not working, silence all work alerts.

* New: [Improve the hard drive monitor system.](projects.md#improve-the-hard-drive-monitor-system)

    Create new seed project to use something like [scrutiny](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny) (there's a [linuxserver image](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-scrutiny)) to collect and display the information. For alerts, use one of their [supported providers](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny#notifications).

* New: [Aggregate all notifications.](projects.md#aggregate-all-notifications)

    Instead of reading the email, github, gitlab, discourse, reddit notifications,
    aggregate all in one place and show them to the user in a nice command line
    interface.

    For the aggregator server, my first choice would be [gotify](https://gotify.net/).

* New: [Add faker-optional to the dormant plant projects.](projects.md#faker-optional)
* New: [Add seedling project to create factoryboy factories from pydantic models automatically.](projects.md#other)

# DevOps

## Continuous Integration

### [Flakehell](flakeheaven.md)

* Correction: Update the git repository.

    The existent repository has been archived in favor of [this one](https://github.com/flakeheaven/flakeheaven)

* New: Explain how to patch the extended_default_ignore error for versions > 3.9.0.

    Add to your your `pyproject.toml`:

    ```ini
    [tool.flakeheaven]
    extended_default_ignore=[]  # add this
    ```

# Coding

## [Python](python.md)

* New: Add apprise to the interesting libraries to explore.

    [apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise): Allows you to send
    a notification to almost all of the most popular notification services
    available to us today such as: Linux, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Amazon
    SNS, Gotify, etc. Look at [all the supported notifications](https://github.com/caronc/apprise#supported-notifications)
    `(¬º-°)¬`.


* New: Add kivi and kivimd to the interesting libraries to explore.

    [kivi](https://kivy.org/) is used to create android/Linux/iOS/Windows applications with python. Use it with [kivimd](https://github.com/kivymd/KivyMD) to make it beautiful, check [the examples](https://github.com/HeaTTheatR/Articles) and the [docs](https://kivymd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


### [Boto3](boto3.md)

* New: Introduce the AWS SDK library and explain how to test it.

    [Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) is
    the AWS SDK for Python to create, configure, and manage AWS services,
    such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage
    Service (Amazon S3). The SDK provides an object-oriented API as well as
    low-level access to AWS services.

    For [testing](boto3.md#testing), try to use [moto](boto3.md#moto), using the [Botocore's stubber](https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/stubber.html) as fallback option.

* New: Explain how to test ec2, route53, s3, and rds resources.
* New: Explain how to test vpc and auto scaling group resources.
* Improvement: Explain how to extract the instance when testing autoscaling groups.

    Also track the [issue to add support to launch templates](boto3.md#issues).

* New: [Explain how to test security groups.](boto3.md#test-security-groups)

### [Logging](python_logging.md)

* New: Explain how to log python program exceptions better than to a file.

    Using `logging` to write write exceptions and breadcrumbs to a file
    might not be the best solution because unless you look at it directly
    most errors will pass unnoticed.

    To actively monitor and react to code exceptions use an application monitoring
    platform like [sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/).

    In the article I explain what are the advantages of using this solution
    and do a comparison between Sentry and [GlitchTip](https://glitchtip.com).

### [DeepDiff](deepdiff.md)

* Improvement: Remove advice to use my fork instead.

    The original one has already merged my [PR](https://github.com/seperman/deepdiff/pull/239) `＼\ ٩( ᐛ )و /／`. Beware though as the `regexp` are not enabled by default (against my will). You need to use the `use_regexp=True` as an argument to `grep` or `DeepSearch`.

### [FactoryBoy](factoryboy.md)

* New: [Explain how to use `Enum` with factoryboy.](factoryboy.md#word-from-enum-choices)

### [Faker](faker.md)

* New: [Explain how to create `Optional` data.](faker.md#create-optional-data)

    [`faker-optional`](https://lyz-code.github.io/faker-optional/) is
    a custom faker provider that acts as a wrapper over other Faker providers to return their value or `None`. Useful to
    create data of type `Optional[Any]`.

### [FastAPI](fastapi.md)

* New: [Explain how to log exceptions to sentry.](fastapi.md#logging-to-sentry)
* New: [Explain how to send raw data to the client.](fastapi.md#sending-data-to-the-client)

    With the [`Response`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-directly/#returning-a-custom-response) object.

* New: [Explain how to configure the application.](fastapi.md#configuration)
* New: [Explain how to inject a testing configuration in the tests.](fastapi.md#inject-testing-configuration)

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* Correction: [Add warning about the method to use direct dependencies.](python_snippets.md#install-a-python-dependency-from-a-git-repository)

    Last time I used this solution, when I added the library on a `setup.py`
    the direct dependencies weren't installed :S

### [Pydantic](pydantic.md)

* New: [Explain how to update entity attributes with a dictionary.](pydantic.md#update-entity-attributes-with-a-dictionary)

    You can create a new object with the new data using the `update`
    argument of the `copy` entity method.

### [rich](rich.md)

* New: Introduce the python cli builder library and it's progress bar.

    [Rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) is a Python library for rich text
    and beautiful formatting in the terminal.

    Check out the beautiful progress bar:

    ```bash
    pip install rich
    python -m rich.progress
    ```


### [Ruamel YAML](ruamel_yaml.md)

* Improvement: Suggest to use ruyaml instead of ruamel.yaml.

    As it's maintained by the community and versioned with git.

# Arts

## [Writing](writing.md)

* New: [Explain when to use I'm good or I'm well.](writing.md#im-good-or-im-well)

    Use I'm well when referring to being ill, use I'm good for the rest.


# Other

* New: Explain how to select a random choice from `Enum` objects.

    [pydantic](pydantic.md) uses `Enum` objects to define [the choices of
    fields](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/types/#enums-and-choices), so
    we need them to create the factories of those objects.

* New: Improve the periodic tasks and application metrics monitoring.

    Setup an [healthchecks](https://healthchecks.io/) instance with the [linuxserver image](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-healthchecks) to monitor cronjobs.

    For the notifications either use the [prometheus metrics](https://healthchecks.io/docs/configuring_prometheus/) or an [apprise](https://github.com/healthchecks/healthchecks/issues/271) compatible system.
