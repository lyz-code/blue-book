# Coding

## Python

### [GitPython](gitpython.md)

* Improvement: Explain how to get the working directory of a repo.

    Using the `working_dir` attribute.
    
    perf(python_snippets#Group a list of dictionaries by a specific key) Explain
    how to group a list of dictionaries by a specific key
    
    With `itertools.groupby`.

### [Jinja2](python_jinja2.md)

* New: Explain how to use Jinja2.

    [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) is a modern and designer-
    friendly
    templating language for Python, modelled after Django’s templates. It is
    fast,
    widely used and secure with the optional sandboxed template execution
    environment.
    
    Add installation, usage and basic and advanced template guidelines.

## [Issues](issues.md)

* Improvement: Monitor today's issues.

    * Mkdocs migration to 7.x is giving errors with the search bar and repo
    stats.

# Life Management

## Automation

### [Amazfit Band 5](amazfit_band_5.md)

* Improvement: Add insights on sleep tracking.

    You can't use the Withings sleep analyzer without their app (as
    expected), maybe the [Emfit
    QS](https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/blob/master/my/emfit/__init__.py)
    is the way to go.
