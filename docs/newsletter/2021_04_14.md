* New: Introduce Beets the music management library.

    [Beets](https://beets.io/) is a music management library used to get your music

    provides a set of tools for manipulating and accessing your music.

### [Mopidy](mopidy.md)

* New: Introduce the music server.

    [Mopidy](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy) is an extensible music server written

    The awesome documentation, being Python based, the extension system,
    JSON-RPC, and JavaScript APIs make Mopidy a perfect base for your
    projects.
