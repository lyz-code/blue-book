* New: Suggest organize to act on computer file changes.

    [organize](https://organize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) looks good for
    automating processes on files. Maybe it's interesting to run it with

    job](https://github.com/tfeldmann/organize/issues/18).

* New: Explain how to use MermaidJS diagrams.
* Correction: Forget to use abolish to insert the elipsis symbol.

    [Peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) is a simple animated GIF screen recorder
    with an easy to use interface.
    
    If you try to use it with i3, you're going to have a bad time, you'd
    [need to
    install](https://github.com/phw/peek#on-i3-the-recording-area-is-all-black-how-can-i-record-anything)
    [Compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton), and then the elements [may
    not even be
    clickable](https://github.com/phw/peek#why-cant-i-interact-with-the-ui-elements-inside-the-recording-area).
