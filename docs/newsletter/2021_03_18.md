# Coding

## Javascript

### [MermaidJS](mermaidjs.md)

* New: Introduce the diagram library and how to make flowchart diagrams.

    [MermaidJS](https://mermaid-js.github.io) is a Javascript library that
    lets you create diagrams using text and code.
    
    It can render the [next diagram
    types](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/?id=diagrams-that-mermaid-can-
    render):
    
    * Flowchart
    * Sequence.
    * Gantt
    * Class
    * Git graph
    * Entity Relationship
    * User journey

# Software Architecture

## [Architecture Decision Record](adr.md)

* Improvement: Explain how to show relationship between ADRs.

    Suggest a [mermaidjs](mermaidjs.md) diagram to show the state of the
    project ADRs.

# Life Management

## Automation

### [Life Automation](life_management.md)

* New: Suggest organize to act on computer file changes.

    [organize](https://organize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) looks good for
    automating processes on files. Maybe it's interesting to run it with
    [inotifywait](https://askubuntu.com/a/819290) instead of with a [cron
    job](https://github.com/tfeldmann/organize/issues/18).

# Operative Systems

## Linux

### [ActivityWatch](activitywatch.md)

* Improvement: Add week insights.

    * [The browser watcher is not very
    accurate](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-web/issues/20).
    * The vim editor watcher doesn't add [git branch
    information](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-vim/issues/19).
    * Syncing data between devices [is not yet
    supported](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/issues/35).

### [Vim Plugins](vim_plugins.md)

* Correction: Forget to use abolish to insert the elipsis symbol.

    Tpope said that it's not going to happen.

### [mkdocs](mkdocs.md)

* New: Explain how to use MermaidJS diagrams.

### [Peek](peek.md)

* New: Introduce Peek the screen recorder.

    [Peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) is a simple animated GIF screen
    recorder
    with an easy to use interface.
    
    If you try to use it with i3, you're going to have a bad time, you'd
    [need to
    install](https://github.com/phw/peek#on-i3-the-recording-area-is-all-black-
    how-can-i-record-anything)
    [Compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton), and then the elements [may
    not even be
    clickable](https://github.com/phw/peek#why-cant-i-interact-with-the-ui-
    elements-inside-the-recording-area).
