# Coding

## [Python](python.md)

* New: Add python landing page.

## Javascript

### [MermaidJS](mermaidjs.md)

* New: Introduce the diagram library and how to make flowchart diagrams.

    [MermaidJS](https://mermaid-js.github.io) is a Javascript library that
    lets you create diagrams using text and code.
    
    It can render the [next diagram
    types](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/?id=diagrams-that-mermaid-can-
    render):
    
    * Flowchart
    * Sequence.
    * Gantt
    * Class
    * Git graph
    * Entity Relationship
    * User journey

## [Issues](issues.md)

* Improvement: Track python dependency errors.

# Software Architecture

## [Architecture Decision Record](adr.md)

* Improvement: Explain how to show relationship between ADRs.

    Suggest a [mermaidjs](mermaidjs.md) diagram to show the state of the
    project ADRs.

# Life Management

## Automation

### [Life Automation](life_management.md)

* New: Suggest organize to act on computer file changes.

    [organize](https://organize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) looks good for
    automating processes on files. Maybe it's interesting to run it with
    [inotifywait](https://askubuntu.com/a/819290) instead of with a [cron
    job](https://github.com/tfeldmann/organize/issues/18).

# Operative Systems

## Linux

### [ActivityWatch](activitywatch.md)

* Improvement: Add week insights.

    * [The browser watcher is not very
    accurate](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-web/issues/20).
    * The vim editor watcher doesn't add [git branch
    information](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-vim/issues/19).
    * Syncing data between devices [is not yet
    supported](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/issues/35).

### [Tabs vs Buffers](vim_tabs.md)

* New: Explain how to use tabs, buffers and windows in vim.

### [Vim Plugins](vim_plugins.md)

* Correction: Forget to use abolish to insert the elipsis symbol.

    Tpope said that it's not going to happen.

* New: Introduce vim-easymotion.

    EasyMotion provides a much simpler way to use some motions in vim. It
    takes the
    `<number>` out of `<number>w` or `<number>f{char}` by highlighting all
    possible
    choices and allowing you to press one key to jump directly to the target.
    
    When one of the available motions is triggered, all visible text preceding
    or
    following the cursor is faded, and motion targets are highlighted.

* Reorganization: Move vim-test to the plugins page.

### [mkdocs](mkdocs.md)

* New: Explain how to use MermaidJS diagrams.
* New: Explain how to test mkdocs plugins.

### [Peek](peek.md)

* New: Introduce Peek the screen recorder.

    [Peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) is a simple animated GIF screen
    recorder
    with an easy to use interface.
    
    If you try to use it with i3, you're going to have a bad time, you'd
    [need to
    install](https://github.com/phw/peek#on-i3-the-recording-area-is-all-black-
    how-can-i-record-anything)
    [Compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton), and then the elements [may
    not even be
    clickable](https://github.com/phw/peek#why-cant-i-interact-with-the-ui-
    elements-inside-the-recording-area).

### [Vim](vim.md)

* New: Add vim landing page.
