# Operative Systems

## Linux

### [ActivityWatch](activitywatch.md)

* New: Introduce ActivityWatch tracking software.

    It's a web application that can be installed both in Linux and Android
    that automatically tracks where you spend the time on.
    
    Super interesting for life logging and automating stuff. Until I save
    some time to react on the data, I'll just gather it and see how to
    aggregate it.

### [Syncthing](syncthing.md)

* Improvement: Mention privacy configurations.

    Disable the [Global
    Discovery](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/security.html#global-discovery)
    and [Relaying
    connections](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/security.html#relay-
    connections)
    options.

## Android

### [Signal](signal.md)

* New: Introduce the messaging app and how to decrypt the backups.
