    [aiomultiprocess](https://github.com/omnilib/aiomultiprocess): Presents
    a simple interface, while running a full AsyncIO event loop on each
    child process, enabling levels of concurrency never before seen in
    a Python application. Each child process can execute multiple coroutines
    at once, limited only by the workload and number of cores available.
