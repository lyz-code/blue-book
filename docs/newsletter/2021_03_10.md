    [wasp-os](https://github.com/daniel-thompson/wasp-os) is an open source
    firmware for smart watches that are based on the nRF52 family of
    microcontrollers. Fully supported by [gadgetbridge](gadgetbridge.md),
    Wasp-os features full heart rate monitoring and step counting support
    together with multiple clock faces, a stopwatch, an alarm clock,
    a countdown timer, a calculator and lots of other games and utilities.
    All of this, and still with access to the MicroPython REPL for
    interactive tweaking, development and testing.
    
    One of the supported devices, the [Colmi
    P8](https://wasp-os.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#colmi-p8),
    looks really good.

* Correction: Explain how to add files through a plugin.

    Long story short, use the `on_config` event instead of `on_files` and
    `on_nav` if you need to add files and want to change the navigation
    menu.
