# [Projects](projects.md)

* New: [Sketch how to automate repetitive tasks prompted by email events.](projects.md#automate-email-management)

    Most of the emails I receive require repetitive actions that can be automated,
    I've stumbled upon [notmuchmail](https://notmuchmail.org/), which looks very
    promising. A friend suggested to use
    [afew](https://afew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for tagging, and I'd probably use
    [alot](https://github.com/pazz/alot) to interact with the system (and finally be
    able to use email from the cli).

* Improvement: [Add interesting interface.](projects.md#quantified-self)

    For the interface [adri's memex](https://github.com/adri/memex) looks awesome!
    It's inspired in the Andrew Louis [talk Building
    a Memex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFWxvQn4cf8&t=1616s) whose [blog
    posts](https://hyfen.net/memex/) seems to be a gold mine.
    
    Also look at [hpi's compilation](https://github.com/hpi/hpi).

* New: [Sketch how to improve the launching of applications with i3wm.](projects.md#improve-the-way-of-launching-applications-with-i3wm)

    In the past I tried installing [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
    without success, I should try again. If the default features are not enough,
    check [adi1090x's custom resources](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi).

* Improvement: [Show the changes of repository-orm 0.3.1.](projects.md#repository-orm)

    +* Add `first` and `last` methods to the repositories.
    +* Make entity `id_` definition optional.
    +* add `_model_name` attribute to entities.

# Coding

## [Python](python.md)

* Improvement: Add FastAPI docs as a model to study and follow.

### [FastAPI](python_plugin_system.md)

* New: Add beets system as a first approach.

    When building Python applications, it's good to develop the core of your
    program, and allow extension via plugins.
    
    I still don't know how to do it, but [Beets plugin system](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dev/plugins.html)
    looks awesome for a first start.
    

* New: Introduce FastAPI the pydantic friendly python framework to build APIs.

    [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a modern, fast (high-performance),
    web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type
    hints.
    

* New: Sum up the basic documentation.

    Explain how to:
    
    * [Sending data to the server](fastapi.md#sending-data-to-the-server):
        Through [path parameters](fastapi.md#path-parameters), [query parameters](fastapi.md#query-parameters) and [body requests](fastapi.md#body-requests).
    * [Handle errors](fastapi.md#handling-errors).
    * [Update data](fastapi.md#updating-data)
    * [Configure OpenAPI](fastapi.md#openapi-configuration)
    * [Test FastAPI applications](fastapi.md#testing)
    
    And add a lot of [more interesting features](fastapi.md#interesting-features-to-explore) I've discovered.
    

### [Pytest](pytest.md)

* New: [Explain how to exclude code from the coverage report.](pytest.md#excluding-code-from-coverage)

    Add `# pragma: no cover`.

### [NetworkX](networkx.md)

* New: Introduce the python library.

    [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) is a Python package for the creation,
    manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex
    networks.

### [Pydantic](pydantic.md)

* New: [Explain how to use private attributes.](pydantic.md#set-private-attributes)

    With the [`PrivateAttr`](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/#private-model-attributes) object.

# Operative Systems

## Linux

### [Beets](beets.md)

* New: Introduce Beets the music management library.

    [Beets](https://beets.io/) is a music management library used to get your music
    collection right once and for all. It catalogs your collection, automatically
    improving its metadata as it goes using the MusicBrainz database. Then it
    provides a set of tools for manipulating and accessing your music.

### [Hushboard](husboard.md)

* New: Introduce Husboard.

    [Hushboard](https://kryogenix.org/code/hushboard/) is an utility that mutes your microphone while you’re typing.
    
    (Thanks [M0wer](https://m0wer.github.io/memento/computer_science/gnu_linux/hushboard/)!)
    

### [Mopidy](mopidy.md)

* New: Introduce the music server.

    [Mopidy](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy) is an extensible music server written
    in Python, that plays perfectly with [beets](beets.md) and the MPD
    ecosystem.
    
    The awesome documentation, being Python based, the extension system,
    JSON-RPC, and JavaScript APIs make Mopidy a perfect base for your
    projects.

# Arts

## Writing

### [Grammar and Orthography](orthography.md)

* New: Explain when to write won't or wont.

    * Won't is the correct way to contract will not.
    * Wont is a synonym of "a habit". For example, "He went for a morning jog, as was his wont".
