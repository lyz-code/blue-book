* New: Introduce vim-easymotion.

    EasyMotion provides a much simpler way to use some motions in vim. It takes the
    `<number>` out of `<number>w` or `<number>f{char}` by highlighting all possible
    choices and allowing you to press one key to jump directly to the target.
    
    When one of the available motions is triggered, all visible text preceding or
    following the cursor is faded, and motion targets are highlighted.
