* New: Compare Nagios and Prometheus as monitoring.
* New: Introduce the fitness band in your life automation.

    [Fitness tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_tracker) or activity
    trackers are devices or applications for monitoring and tracking fitness-related
    metrics such as distance walked or run, calorie consumption, and in some cases
    heartbeat. It is a type of wearable computer.
    
    Explain also why it's interesting

* Correction: Improve the comparison.

    * State that nagios is not easy to configure. If you're used to it it
        is, otherwise it's not.
    * Add that grafana has a huge community building graphs.
    * Mention Thanos as the long term storage solution for Prometheus.
    

* New: Add insights on sleep detection.

    The sleep tracking using Gadgetbridge is not [good at
    all](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Huami-Deep-Sleep-Detection).
    After two nights, the band has not been able to detect when I woke in the middle
    of the night, or when I really woke up, as I usually stay in the bed for a time
    before standing up. I'll try with the proprietary application soon and compare results.

* New: Explain how to upgrade the firmware.

    Gadgetbridge people have a [guide on how to upgrade the
    firmware](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Amazfit-Band-5-Firmware-Update),
    you need to get the firmware from the [geek doing
    forum](https://geekdoing.com/threads/amazfit-band-5-original-firmwares-resources-fonts.2331/)
    though, so it is interesting to create an account and watch the post.

* New: Add more guidelines to reverse engineer the band protocol.
* New: Add today's issues.

    * Gadgetbridge improvements
    * Ombi improvements

* Correction: Add the insights of a nagios power user.

    * Update open source and community analysis with nagios exchange.
    * Correct nagios community analysis with its trajectory
    * Correct the analysis of the high availability of nagios
    * Add the option to host the script exporter in a dedicated server
    

* Improvement: Add insights on sleep tracking.

    You can't use the Withings sleep analyzer without their app (as
    expected), maybe the [Emfit
    QS](https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/blob/master/my/emfit/__init__.py)
    is the way to go.

* Improvement: Explain how to get the working directory of a repo.

    Using the `working_dir` attribute.
    
    perf(python_snippets#Group a list of dictionaries by a specific key) Explain how to group a list of dictionaries by a specific key
    
    With `itertools.groupby`.

* Improvement: Monitor today's issues.

    * Mkdocs migration to 7.x is giving errors with the search bar and repo
    stats.

* New: Explain how to use Jinja2.

    [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) is a modern and designer-friendly
    templating language for Python, modelled after Djangoâ€™s templates. It is fast,
    widely used and secure with the optional sandboxed template execution
    environment.
    
    Add installation, usage and basic and advanced template guidelines.
    

* Correction: Deprecate mkdocs issues.

    They've been fixed in the last release
