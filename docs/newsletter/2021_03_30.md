## [Issues](issues.md)

* Correction: Jellyfin login page problem after upgrade to 10.7.X is solved.

    Surprisingly the instructions in
    [#5489](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/5489) solved it.
    
    ```bash
    systemctl stop jellyfin.service
    mv /var/lib/jellyfin/data/jellyfin.db{,.bak}
    systemctl start jellyfin.service
    
    [ Go to JF URL, get asked to log in even though there are no Users in the JF DB now]
    
    systemctl stop jellyfin.service
    mv /var/lib/jellyfin/data/jellyfin.db{.bak,}
    systemctl start jellyfin.service
    ```

* New: Introduce the media system and monitor interesting issues.

    [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) is a Free Software Media System that puts you
    in control of managing and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the
    proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user
    devices via multiple apps. Jellyfin is descended from Emby's 3.5.2 release and
    ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full cross-platform support. There
    are no strings attached, no premium licenses or features, and no hidden agendas:
    just a team who want to build something better and work together to achieve it.
