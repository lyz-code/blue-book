# [Fix docker error: KeyError ContainerConfig](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1508129/docker-compose-giving-containerconfig-errors-after-update-today)
A patch is to run `docker-compose down` and then up again. The solution is to upgrade docker and use `docker compose` instead.

# [Set static ip with nmcli](https://www.clearlinux.org/clear-linux-documentation/guides/network/assign-static-ip.html)
```bash
nmcli con mod "your-ssid" ipv4.addresses 
  ipv4.method "manual" \
  ipv4.addresses "your_desired_ip" \
  ipv4.gateway "your_desired_gateway" \
  ipv4.dns "1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2" \ 
  ipv4.routes "192.168.32.0 0.0.0.0" \
```

The last one is to be able to connect to your LAN, change the value accordingly.
# [Fix unbound variable error](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/463034/bash-throws-error-line-8-1-unbound-variable)
You can check if the variable is set and non-empty with:
```bash
[ -n "${myvariable-}" ] 
```
# [Do relative import of a bash library](https://code-maven.com/bash-shell-relative-path)
If you want to import a file `lib.sh` that lives in the same directory as the file that is importing it you can use the next snippet:

```bash
# shellcheck source=lib.sh
source "$(dirname "$(realpath "$0")")/lib.sh"
```

If you use `source ./lib.sh` you will get an import error if you run the script on any other place that is not the directory where `lib.sh` lives.
# [Check the battery status](https://www.howtogeek.com/810971/how-to-check-a-linux-laptops-battery-from-the-command-line/)
This [article gives many ways to check the status of a battery](https://www.howtogeek.com/810971/how-to-check-a-linux-laptops-battery-from-the-command-line/), for my purposes the next one is enough

```bash 
cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity
```
# [Check if file is being sourced](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/424492/how-to-define-a-shell-script-to-be-sourced-not-run)


Assuming that you are running bash, put the following code near the start of the script that you want to be sourced but not executed:

```bash
if [ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" -ef "$0" ]
then
    echo "Hey, you should source this script, not execute it!"
    exit 1
fi
```

Under bash, `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` will contain the name of the current file that the shell is reading regardless of whether it is being sourced or executed.

By contrast, `$0` is the name of the current file being executed.

`-ef` tests if these two files are the same file. If they are, we alert the user and exit.

Neither `-ef` nor `BASH_SOURCE` are POSIX. While `-ef` is supported by ksh, yash, zsh and Dash, BASH_SOURCE requires bash. In zsh, however, `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` could be replaced by `${(%):-%N}`.
# Parsing bash arguments

Long story short, it's nasty, think of using a python script with [typer](typer.md) instead.

There are some possibilities to do this:

- [The old getops](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/bash-parse-command-line-arguments)
- [argbash](https://github.com/matejak/argbash) library
- [Build your own parser](https://medium.com/@Drew_Stokes/bash-argument-parsing-54f3b81a6a8f)

# [Compare two semantic versions](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/compare-dot-separated-version-string)

## With sort 
If you want to make it work in non-Debian based systems you can use `sort -V -C`

```bash
printf "2.0.0\n2.1.0\n" | sort -V -C  # Return code 0
printf "2.2.0\n2.1.0\n" | sort -V -C  # Return code 1
```
## With dpkg
[This article](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/compare-dot-separated-version-string) gives a lot of ways to do it. For my case the simplest is to use `dpkg` to compare two strings in dot-separated version format in bash.

```bash
Usage: dpkg --compare-versions <condition>
```

If the condition is `true`, the status code returned by `dpkg` will be zero (indicating success). So, we can use this command in an `if` statement to compare two version numbers:
```bash
$ if $(dpkg --compare-versions "2.11" "lt" "3"); then echo true; else echo false; fi
true
```

# [Exclude list of extensions from find command ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44030071/exclude-list-of-file-extensions-from-find-in-bash-shell) 


```bash
find . -not \( -name '*.sh' -o -name '*.log' \)
```

# [Self delete shell script ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8981164/self-deleting-shell-script) 

Add at the end of the script

```bash
rm -- "$0"
```

`$0` is a magic variable for the full path of the executed script.
# [Add a user to the sudoers through command line ](https://askubuntu.com/questions/7477/how-can-i-add-a-user-as-a-new-sudoer-using-the-command-line) 

Add the user to the sudo group:

```bash
sudo  usermod -a -G sudo <username>
```

The change will take effect the next time the user logs in.

This works because `/etc/sudoers` is pre-configured to grant permissions to all members of this group (You should not have to make any changes to this):

```bash
# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

# Error management done well in bash
If you wish to capture error management in bash you can use the next format

```bash
if ( ! echo "$EMAIL" >> "$USER_TOTP_FILE" ) then
	echo "** Error: could not associate email for user $USERNAME"
	exit 1
fi
```
# Show the progresion of a long running task with dots

```bash
echo -n "Process X is running."

# Process is running
sleep 1 
echo -n "."
sleep 1 
echo -n "."

# Process ended
echo ""
```

# [Loop through a list of files found by find](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9612090/how-to-loop-through-file-names-returned-by-find)

For simple loops use the `find -exec` syntax:

```bash
# execute `process` once for each file
find . -name '*.txt' -exec process {} \;
```

For more complex loops use a `while read` construct:

```bash
find . -name "*.txt" -print0 | while read -r -d $'\0' file; do
    …code using "$file"
done
```

The loop will execute while the `find` command is executing. Plus, this command will work even if a file name is returned with whitespace in it. And, you won't overflow your command line buffer.

The `-print0` will use the NULL as a file separator instead of a newline and the `-d $'\0'` will use NULL as the separator while reading.

## How not to do it

If you try to run the next snippet:

```bash
# Don't do this
for file in $(find . -name "*.txt")
do
    …code using "$file"
done
```

You'll get the next [`shellcheck`](shellcheck.md) warning:

```
SC2044: For loops over find output are fragile. Use find -exec or a while read loop.
```

You should not do this because:

Three reasons:

- For the for loop to even start, the find must run to completion.
- If a file name has any whitespace (including space, tab or newline) in it, it will be treated as two separate names.
- Although now unlikely, you can overrun your command line buffer. Imagine if your command line buffer holds 32KB, and your for loop returns 40KB of text. That last 8KB will be dropped right off your for loop and you'll never know it.

# [Remove the lock screen in ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1140079/completely-remove-lockscreen)

Create the `/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/90_ubuntu-settings.gschema.override` file with the next content:

```ini
[org.gnome.desktop.screensaver]
lock-enabled = false
[org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power]
idle-dim = false
```

Then reload the schemas with:

```bash
sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/
```

# [How to deal with HostContextSwitching alertmanager alert](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/69271)

A context switch is described as the kernel suspending execution of one process on the CPU and resuming execution of some other process that had previously been suspended. A context switch is required for every interrupt and every task that the scheduler picks.

Context switching can be due to multitasking, Interrupt handling , user & kernel mode switching. The interrupt rate will naturally go high, if there is higher network traffic, or higher disk traffic. Also it is dependent on the application which every now and then invoking system calls.

If the cores/CPU's are not sufficient to handle load of threads created by application will also result in context switching.

It is not a cause of concern until performance breaks down. This is expected that CPU will do context switching. One shouldn't verify these data at first place since there are many statistical data which should be analyzed prior to looking into kernel activities. Verify the CPU, memory and network usage during this time. 

You can see which process is causing issue with the next command:

```bash

```

The columns are:

- UID: The real user identification number of the task being monitored.
- USER: The name of the real user owning the task being monitored.
- PID: The identification number of the task being monitored.
- cswch/s: Total  number of voluntary context switches the task made per second.  A voluntary context switch occurs when a task blocks because it requires a  resource  that  is unavailable.
- nvcswch/s: Total number of non voluntary context switches the task made per second.  A involuntary context switch takes place when a task executes for  the  duration  of  its time slice and then is forced to relinquish the processor.
- Command: The command name of the task.

Then with help of PID which is causing issue, one can get all system calls details:
Raw

```bash
# strace -c -f -p <pid of process/thread>
```

Let this command run for a few minutes while the load/context switch rates are high. It is safe to run this on a production system so you could run it on a good system as well to provide a comparative baseline. Through strace, one can debug & troubleshoot the issue, by looking at system calls the process has made.

# [Update a json file with jq](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36565295/jq-to-replace-text-directly-on-file-like-sed-i)

Save the next snippet to a file, for example `jqr` and add it to your `$PATH`.

```bash
#!/bin/zsh

query="$1"
file=$2

temp_file="$(mktemp)"

# Update the content
jq "$query" $file > "$temp_file"

# Check if the file has changed
cmp -s "$file" "$temp_file"
if [[ $? -eq 0 ]] ; then
  /bin/rm "$temp_file"
else
  /bin/mv "$temp_file" "$file"
fi
```

Imagine you have the next json file:

```json
{
  "property": true,
  "other_property": "value"
}
```

Then you can run:

```bash
jqr '.property = false' status.json
```

And then you'll have:

```json
{
  "property": false,
  "other_property": "value"
}
```
