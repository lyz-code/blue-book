[Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) is a logic-based,
combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic Sudoku, the objective is to
fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the
nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or
"regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides
a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single
solution.
