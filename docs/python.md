[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) is an
interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's
design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of
significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach
aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale
projects.

# Install

```bash
apt-get install python
```

## [Install a specific version](https://bobcares.com/blog/how-to-install-python-3-9-on-debian-10/)

* Install dependencies
    ```bash
    sudo apt install wget software-properties-common build-essential libnss3-dev zlib1g-dev libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev libbz2-dev
    ```

* Select the version in https://www.python.org/ftp/python/ and download it
    ```bash
    wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.8/Python-3.11.8.tgz
    unp Python-3.11.8.tgz
    cd Python-3.11.8/
    ./configure --enable-optimizations
    sudo make altinstall

* If you want to change the machine default `python3` interpreter you can:
  ```bash
  sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.8 8
  sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.11 11
  ```
# [Generators](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/)

Generator functions are a special kind of function that return a lazy iterator.
These are objects that you can loop over like a list. However, unlike lists,
lazy iterators do not store their contents in memory.

An example would be an infinite sequence generator

```python
def infinite_sequence():
    num = 0
    while True:
        yield num
        num += 1
```

You can use it as a list:

```python
for i in infinite_sequence():
...     print(i, end=" ")
...
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29
30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42
[...]
```

Instead of using a `for` loop, you can also call `next()` on the generator object
directly. This is especially useful for testing a generator in the console:.

```python
>>> gen = infinite_sequence()
>>> next(gen)
0
>>> next(gen)
1
>>> next(gen)
2
>>> next(gen)
3
```

## [Understanding Generators](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/#understanding-generators)

Generator functions look and act just like regular functions, but with one
defining characteristic. Generator functions use the Python `yield` keyword
instead of `return`.

`yield` indicates where a value is sent back to the caller, but unlike `return`,
you don’t exit the function afterward.Instead, the state of the function is
remembered. That way, when `next()` is called on a generator object (either
explicitly or implicitly within a for loop), the previously yielded variable
`num` is incremented, and then yielded again.

# [Exceptions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_exceptions.asp)

The table below shows built-in exceptions that are usually raised in Python:

| Exception | 	Description |
| --- | --- |
| ArithmeticError | 	Raised when an error occurs in numeric calculations |
| AssertionError | 	Raised when an assert statement fails |
| AttributeError | 	Raised when attribute reference or assignment fails |
| Exception | 	Base class for all exceptions |
| EOFError | 	Raised when the input() method hits an "end of file" condition (EOF) |
| FloatingPointError | 	Raised when a floating point calculation fails |
| GeneratorExit | 	Raised when a generator is closed (with the close() method) |
| ImportError | 	Raised when an imported module does not exist |
| IndentationError | 	Raised when indentation is not correct |
| IndexError | 	Raised when an index of a sequence does not exist |
| KeyError | 	Raised when a key does not exist in a dictionary |
| KeyboardInterrupt | 	Raised when the user presses Ctrl+c, Ctrl+z or Delete |
| LookupError | 	Raised when errors raised cant be found |
| MemoryError | 	Raised when a program runs out of memory |
| NameError | 	Raised when a variable does not exist |
| NotImplementedError | 	Raised when an abstract method requires an inherited class to override the method |
| OSError | 	Raised when a system related operation causes an error |
| OverflowError | 	Raised when the result of a numeric calculation is too large |
| ReferenceError | 	Raised when a weak reference object does not exist |
| RuntimeError | 	Raised when an error occurs that do not belong to any specific exceptions |
| StopIteration | 	Raised when the next() method of an iterator has no further values |
| SyntaxError | 	Raised when a syntax error occurs |
| TabError | 	Raised when indentation consists of tabs or spaces |
| SystemError | 	Raised when a system error occurs |
| SystemExit | 	Raised when the sys.exit() function is called |
| TypeError | 	Raised when two different types are combined |
| UnboundLocalError | 	Raised when a local variable is referenced before assignment |
| UnicodeError | 	Raised when a unicode problem occurs |
| UnicodeEncodeError | 	Raised when a unicode encoding problem occurs |
| UnicodeDecodeError | 	Raised when a unicode decoding problem occurs |
| UnicodeTranslateError | 	Raised when a unicode translation problem occurs |
| ValueError | 	Raised when there is a wrong value in a specified data type |
| ZeroDivisionError | 	Raised when the second operator in a division is zero |
