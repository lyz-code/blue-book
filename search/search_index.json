The work place is usually not considered a safe space by the employees because they may:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Fear of being judged: We want people to like us and not just in our     personal lives, but in our professional lives as well. It also seems to bear     a bigger importance that our supervisor likes us because he holds the power     over our career and financial security. So we live in a constant state of     anxiety of what might happen if our manager doesn't like us.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fear of losing their job: It\u2019s a form of self-preservation, abstaining from     saying something that may be perceived as wrong to someone in a position of     authority.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fear of being singled out: Giving direct feedback puts you in the spotlight.     Being highlighted against the rest of the employees might be seen as     a threat, especially by people belonging to a different race, gender,     national origin, or other identities than most of their coworkers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Feel insecure: People may distrust their colleagues, because they     just arrived at the organization or may have negative past experiences either with     them or with similar people. They may not have a solid stance on an issue,     be shy or have problems of self esteem.</p> </li> <li> <p>Distrust the open-door internal policies: Past experiences in other     companies may lead the employee not to trust open-doors policies until they     have seen them in practice.</p> </li> <li> <p>Not knowing the internal processes of the organization: As a Slack study     shows,     55 percent of business owners described their organization as very transparent,     but only 18 percent of their employees would agree.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For all these reasons, some employees may remain silent when asked for direct feedback, to speak up against an internal issue or in need to report a colleague or manager. These factors are further amplified if:</p> <ul> <li>The person belongs to a minority group inside the organization.</li> <li>The greater the difference in position between the talking parties. It's more     difficult to talk to the CEO than to the immediate manager.</li> </ul> <p>Until the safe space is built where direct feedback is viable, anonymous feedback gives these employees a mechanism to raise their concerns, practice their feedback-giving skills, test the waters, and understand how people perceive their constructive (and sometimes critical) opinions, thus building the needed trust.</p>"}, {"location": "anonymous_feedback/#pros-and-cons", "title": "Pros and cons", "text": "<p>Pros of Anonymous Feedback:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Employees can express themselves freely and provide valuable insights: On     topics that are considered sensitive, you\u2019ll often find employees who are     afraid to share their opinions. But when employees have the option to use     anonymous feedback, you will be offering a safe space for them to share     their honest, constructive feedback about sensitive workplace issues,     without fear of being judged, victimized, radicalized or labelled in any     way.</p> <p>A formal, non-anonymous feedback form will only reveal some of the superficial, non-threatening issues that affect the workplace, without mentioning the most important, underlying problems. The real problems that no one talks about because they know they are so important that they could stir things up.</p> <p>In fact, these controversial, important issues are the ones that need to be brought to the table as soon as possible. They should be addressed by the entire team before they become a source of unhappiness, conflict and lack of productivity.</p> <p>An anonymous feedback instrument gives you real power over those issues because it doesn't matter who brought it up, but that it\u2019s resolved. For a manager, that insight is invaluable.</p> </li> <li> <p>It builds trust: Anonymous feedback allows the employee see how management     reacts to feedback, understand how people perceive their constructive (and     sometimes critical) opinions, how are the open-door policies being applied     and build up self esteem.</p> </li> <li> <p>It offers a sense of security: Anonymity soothes the employee anxiety and     creates a greater willingness to share our ideas and opinions.</p> </li> <li> <p>It allows every voice to be heard and respected: In workplaces, where they     practice direct or attributed feedback, leaders may give preference to some     voices over others. Due to our unconscious biases, people of higher     authority, backgrounds, or eloquence tend to command respect and attention.     In such situations, the issues they raise are likely to get immediate     attention than those raised by the rest of the group. However, when feedback     is collected anonymously, it eliminates biases and allows leaders to focus     entirely on the feedback.</p> </li> <li> <p>It encourages new employees to share their opinions:     Research     has shown that new employees, who happen to be less senior or influential,     see anonymous feedback as more appropriate for formal and informal     evaluations than their older colleagues. Typically, the last thing a new     employee wants is to start on the wrong foot, so they maintain a neutral     stance. Using anonymous feedback can make new employees feel     more comfortable sharing their real opinions on workplace issues.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Cons of Anonymous Feedback:</p> <ul> <li> <p>It can breed hostility: According to this Harvard Business Review article,     anonymity often sets off a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d, where leaders seek to know the     source of a negative comment. On the one hand, employees can hide behind     anonymity to say personal and hurtful things about their colleagues or     leaders. On the other hand, leaders may take constructive feedback as     a personal attack and become suspicious and hostile to all their     employees.</p> </li> <li> <p>It can be less impactful than attributed feedback: When using attributed     feedback where responses carry the employees\u2019 names, information can be     analyzed for relevance and impact. However, with anonymous feedback, it can     be difficult to analyze information accurately. It is not uncommon for     companies who choose to practice anonymous feedback, to find less specific     responses since details may reveal respondents\u2019 identities. Vague feedback     from employees would have less power to influence behaviors or drive change     in the organization.</p> </li> <li> <p>It can be difficult to act on: Since anonymous feedback is often difficult     to trace, it can be challenging for the organization to get context or     follow up on important issues, especially when a problem is peculiar to an     individual.</p> </li> </ul>"}, {"location": "anonymous_feedback/#how-to-request-anonymous-feedback", "title": "How to request anonymous feedback", "text": "<p>When requesting for anonymous feedback on an organizational level, it is necessary to:</p> <ul> <li>Set expectations for employees: Let your colleagues know how important their     feedback is to the organization.

Now Shevek, a brilliant physicist, is determined to reunite the two planets, which have been divided by centuries of distrust. He will seek ans\nwers, question the unquestionable, and attempt to tear down the walls of hatred that have kept them apart.To visit Urras\u2014to learn, to teach, to share\u2014will require great sacrifice and risks, which Shevek willingly\n accepts.

It works well because it mocks out all calls to AWS automatically without requiring any dependency injection. The downside is that it goes behind <code>boto3</code> so some of the methods you need to test won't be still implemented, that leads us to the third option.</p> <p>Botocore's Stubber is a class that allows you to stub out requests so you don't have to hit an endpoint to write tests. Responses are returned first in, first out. If operations are called out of order, or are called with no remaining queued responses, an error will be raised. It's like the first option but cleaner.

If you want the best CPU clock speed possible, you\u2019ll still want to buy an     aftermarket cooler, but for many Ryzen owners, that won\u2019t be necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p>Check clearances before buying: Big air coolers and low-profile models can     bump up against tall RAM and even VRM heat sinks sometimes.

In this way, we not only prevent needing to synchronize the state between the server and browser, but we also prevent mutating state from our tests. That means tests won't build up state that may affect other tests.</p> <p>Another upside is that this enables you to build out your application without needing the contract of the server to exist. You can build it the way you want the data to be structured, and even test all of the edge cases, without needing a server.</p> <p>However - there is likely still a balance here where both strategies are valid (and you should likely do them).</p> <p>While stubbing is great, it means that you don't have the guarantees that these response payloads actually match what the server will send. However, there are still many valid ways to get around this:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Generate the fixture stubs ahead of time: You could have the server generate     all of the fixture stubs for you ahead of time. This means their data will     reflect what the server will actually send.</p> </li> <li> <p>Write a single e2e test without stubs, and then stub the rest: Another more     balanced approach is to integrate both strategies. You likely want to have     a single test that takes a true e2e approach and stubs nothing. It'll use     the feature for real - including seeding the database and setting up state.</p> <p>Once you've established it's working you can then use stubs to test all of the edge cases and additional scenarios.

Instead, you need to create an empty pass entry in <code>docker-credential-helpers/docker-pass-initialized-check</code>, and when you use <code>docker login</code>, manually introducing your data, it creates another entry, as you can see in the next <code>pass</code> output:</p> <pre><code>Password Store\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 docker-credential-helpers\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 aHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRleC5kb2NrZXIuaW8vdjEv\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 lyz\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 docker-pass-initialized-check\n</code></pre> <p>That entry is removed when you use <code>docker logout</code> so the next time you log in you need to introduce the user and password <code>(\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0)\u256f \u253b\u2501\u253b</code>.</p>"}, {"location": "docker/#installing-docker-credential-pass", "title": "Installing docker-credential-pass", "text": "<p>You first need to install the script:</p> <pre><code># Check for later releases at https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/releases\nversion=\"v0.6.3\"\narchive=\"docker-credential-pass-$version-amd64.tar.gz\"\nurl=\"https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/releases/download/$version/$archive\"\n\n# Download cred helper, unpack, make executable, and move it where Docker will find it.\nwget $url \\\n&amp;&amp; tar -xf $archive \\\n&amp;&amp; chmod +x docker-credential-pass \\\n&amp;&amp; mv -f docker-credential-pass /usr/local/bin/\n</code></pre> <p>Another tricky issue is that even if you use a non-root user who's part of the <code>docker</code> group, the script is not aware of that, so it will look in the password store of root instead of the user's. This means that additionally to your own, you need to create a new password store for root. Follow the next steps with the root user:</p> <ul> <li>Create the password with <code>gpg --full-gen</code>, and copy the key id. Use a non     empty password, otherwise you are getting the same security as with the     password in cleartext.</li> <li>Initialize the password store <code>pass init gpg_id</code>, changing <code>gpg_id</code> for the     one of the last step.</li> <li> <p>Create the empty <code>docker-credential-helpers/docker-pass-initialized-check</code>     entry:</p> <pre><code>pass insert docker-credential-helpers/docker-pass-initialized-check\n</code></pre> <p>And press enter twice.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Finally we need to specify in the root's docker configuration that we want to use the <code>pass</code> credential storage.</p> <p>File: /root/.docker/config.json</p> <pre><code>{\n\"credsStore\": \"pass\"\n}\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "docker/#testing-it-works", "title": "Testing it works", "text": "<p>To test that docker is able to use pass as backend to store the credentials, run <code>docker login</code> and introduce the user and password.

Don't worry it gets worse.</p> <p>Now that you're logged in, whenever you try to push an image you're probably going to get an <code>denied: requested access to the resource is denied</code> error. That's because docker is not able to use the password it has stored in the root's password store. If you're using <code>root</code> to push the image (bad idea anyway), you will need to <code>export GPG_TTY=$(tty)</code> so that docker can ask you for your password to unlock root's <code>pass</code> entry.

This could be contributed to the site.</p> <p>Something that is needed is a command line tool that reads the list of ill torrents, and downloads the torrents that have a low number of seeders and DHT peers. The number of torrents to download could be limited by the amount the user wants to share.

Instead I suggest a variation of the Github workflow.</p> <p>To carry out a reliable continuous delivery we must work to comply with the following list of best practices:</p> <ul> <li>Everything must be in the git server: source code, tests, pipelines, scripts,   templates and documentation.</li> <li>There is only a main branch (main) whose key is that everything is in this   branch must be always stable and deployable into production at any time.</li> <li>New branches are created from main in order to develop new features that   should be merged into main branch in short development cycles.</li> <li>It is highly recommended to do small commits to have more control over what is   being done and to avoid discarding many lines of code if a rollback has to be   done.</li> <li>A commit message policy should be set so that they are clear and conform the   same pattern, for example semantic versioning.</li> <li><code>main</code> is blocked to reject direct pushes as well as to protect it of   catastrophic deletion. Only pre-validated merge requests are accepted.</li> <li>When a feature is ready, we will open a merge request to merge changes into   <code>main</code> branch.</li> <li>Use webhooks to automate the execution of tests and validation tasks in the CI   server before/after adding changes in main.</li> <li>It is not needed to discard a merge request if any of the validation tasks   failed. We check the code and when the changes are pushed, the CI server will   relaunch the validation tasks.</li> <li>If all validation tasks pass, we will assign the merge request to two team   developers to review the feature code.</li> <li>After both reviewers validate the code, the merge request can be accepted and   the feature branch may be deleted.</li> <li>A clear versioning policy must be adopted for all generated artifacts.</li> <li>Each artifact must be generated once and be promoted to the different   environments in different stages.</li> </ul> <p>When a developer wants to add code to main should proceed as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Wait until the pipeline execution ends if it exists. If that process fails,   then the developer must help to other team members to fix the issue before   requesting a new merge request.</li> <li>Pull the changes from main and resolve the conflicts locally before pushing   the code to the new feature branch.</li> <li>Run a local script that compiles and executes the tests before committing   changes. This task can be done executing it manually by the developer or using   a git precommit.</li> <li>Open a new merge request setting the feature branch as source branch and main   as target branch.</li> <li>The CI server is notified of the new merge request and executes the pipeline   which compiles the source code, executes the tests, deploys the artifact, etc.</li> <li>If there are errors in the previous step, the developer must fix the code and   push it to the git server as soon as possible so that the CI server validate   once again the merge request.</li> <li>If no errors, the CI server will mark the merge request as OK and the   developer can assign it to two other team members to review the feature code.</li> <li>At this point, the developer can start with other task.</li> </ul> <p>Considerations</p> <p>The build process and the execution of the tests have to be pretty fast.

Let's see each of them:</p> <ul> <li>The reason people are implementing the change is because other people are   doing it: After a quick search I found that the first one to do the change   was   the software freedom conservancy with the Git project.   You can also see Python,   Django,   Redis,   Drupal,   CouchDB and   Github's   statements.</li> </ul> <p>As we're not part of the deciding organisms of the collectives doing the   changes, all we can use are their statements and discussions to guess what are   the reasons behind their support of the change. Despite that some of them do   use the argument that other communities do support the change to emphasize the   need of the change, all of them mention that the main reason is that the term   is offensive to some people.</p> <ul> <li>I don't see an issue using the term master: If you relate to this statement   it can be because you're not part of the communities that suffer the   oppression tied to the term, and that makes you blind to the issue. It's a   lesson I learned on my own skin throughout the years. There are thousand of   situations, gestures, double meaning words and sentences that went unnoticed   by me until I started discussing it with the people that are suffering them   (women, racialized people, LGTBQI+, ...). Throughout my experience I've seen   that the more privileged you are, the blinder you become. You can read more on   privileged blindness   here,   here or   here   (I've skimmed through the articles, and are the first articles I've found,   there are probably better references).</li> </ul> <p>I'm not saying that privileged people are not aware of the issues or that they   can even raise them. We can do so and more we read, discuss and train   ourselves, the better we'll detect them. All I'm saying is that a non   privileged person will always detect more because they suffer them daily.</p> <p>I understand that for you there is no issue using the word master, there   wasn't an issue for me either until I saw these projects doing the change,   again I was blinded to the issue as I'm not suffering it. That's because   change is not meant for us, as we're not triggered by it. The change is   targeted to the people that do perceive that <code>master</code> is an offensive term.   What we can do is empathize with them and follow this tiny tiny tiny gesture.   It's the least we can do.</p> <p>Think of a term that triggers you, such as heil hitler, imagine that those   words were being used to define the main branch of your code, and that   everyday you sit in front of your computer you see them. You'll probably be   reminded of the historic events, concepts, feelings that are tied to that term   each time you see it, and being them quite negative it can slowly mine you.   Therefore it's legit that you wouldn't want to be exposed to that negative   effects.</p> <ul> <li>I don't see who will benefit from this change: Probably the people that   belongs to communities that are and have been under constant oppression for a   very long time, in this case, specially the racialized ones which have   suffered slavery.</li> </ul> <p>Sadly you will probably won't see many the affected people speak in these   discussions, first because there are not that many, sadly the IT world is   dominated by middle aged, economically comfortable, white, cis, hetero, males.   Small changes like this are meant to foster diversity in the community by   allowing them being more comfortable. Secondly because when they see these   debates they move on as they are so fed up on teaching privileged people of   their privileges. They not only have to suffer the oppression, we also put the   burden on their shoulders to teach us.</p> <p>As and ending thought, if you see yourself being specially troubled by the change, having a discomfort feeling and strong reactions. In my experience these signs are characteristic of privileged people that feel that their privileges are being threatened, I've felt them myself countless times. When I feel it, I usually do two things, fight them as strong as I can, or embrace them, analyze them, and go to the root of them.

Removing unnecessary code or exposed attack surface eliminates many vulnerabilities completely. GrapheneOS avoids removing any useful functionality for end users, but we can still disable lots of functionality by default and require that users opt-in to using it to eliminate it for most of them. An example we landed upstream in Android is disallowing using the kernel's profiling support by default, since it was and still is a major source of Linux kernel vulnerabilities.</p> <p>The next line of defense is preventing an attacker from exploiting a vulnerability, either by making it impossible, unreliable or at least meaningfully harder to develop. The vast majority of vulnerabilities are well understood classes of bugs and exploitation can be prevented by avoiding the bugs via languages/tooling or preventing exploitation with strong exploit mitigations. In many cases, vulnerability classes can be completely wiped out while in many others they can at least be made meaningfully harder to exploit. Android does a lot of work in this area and GrapheneOS has helped to advance this in Android and the Linux kernel.</p> <p>The final line of defense is containment through sandboxing at various levels: fine-grained sandboxes around a specific context like per site browser renderers, sandboxes around a specific component like Android's media codec sandbox and app / workspace sandboxes like the Android app sandbox used to sandbox each app which is also the basis for user/work profiles. GrapheneOS improves all of these sandboxes through fortifying the kernel and other base OS components along with improving the sandboxing policies.</p> <p>Preventing an attacker from persisting their control of a component or the OS / firmware through verified boot and avoiding trust in persistent state also helps to mitigate the damage after a compromise has occurred.</p>"}, {"location": "grapheneos/#attack-surface-reduction", "title": "Attack surface reduction", "text": "<ul> <li>Greatly reduced remote, local and proximity-based attack surface by stripping   out unnecessary code, making more features optional and disabling optional   features by default (NFC, Bluetooth, etc.), when the screen is locked   (connecting new USB peripherals, camera access) and optionally after a timeout   (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi)</li> <li>Option to disable native debugging (ptrace) to reduce local attack surface   (still enabled by default for compatibility)</li> </ul>"}, {"location": "grapheneos/#downsides", "title": "Downsides", "text": "<p>It looks that the community behind GrapheneOS is not the kindest one, they are sometimes harsh and when they are questioned they enter a defensive position.

There are several solutions, such as using RAID to minimize the impact of a disk loss, but even then, we should monitor the bad sectors to see when are our disks dying.</p> <p>S.M.A.R.T (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology; often written as SMART) is a monitoring system included in computer hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and eMMC drives. Its primary function is to detect and report various indicators of drive reliability with the intent of anticipating imminent hardware failures.</p> <p>Between all the SMART attributes, some that define define the health status of the hard drive, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Reallocated Sectors Count:  Count of reallocated sectors. The raw value   represents a count of the bad sectors that have been found and remapped.   Thus, the higher the attribute value, the more sectors the drive has had to   reallocate. This value is primarily used as a metric of the life expectancy of   the drive; a drive which has had any reallocations at all is significantly   more likely to fail in the immediate months.</li> <li>Spin Retry Count: Count of retry of spin start attempts. This attribute   stores a total count of the spin start attempts to reach the fully operational   speed (under the condition that the first attempt was unsuccessful). An   increase of this attribute value is a sign of problems in the hard disk   mechanical subsystem.</li> <li>Reallocate Event Count: Count of remap operations. The raw value of this   attribute shows the total count of attempts to transfer data from reallocated   sectors to a spare area. Both successful and unsuccessful attempts are   counted.</li> <li> <p>Current Pending Sector Count: Count of \"unstable\" sectors (waiting to be     remapped, because of unrecoverable read errors). If an unstable sector is     subsequently read successfully, the sector is remapped and this value is     decreased. Read errors on a sector will not remap the sector immediately     (since the correct value cannot be read and so the value to remap is not     known, and also it might become readable later); instead, the drive     firmware remembers that the sector needs to be remapped, and will remap it     the next time it's written.</p> <p>However, some drives will not immediately remap such sectors when written; instead the drive will first attempt to write to the problem sector and if the write operation is successful then the sector will be marked good (in this case, the \"Reallocation Event Count\" (0xC4) will not be increased). This is a serious shortcoming, for if such a drive contains marginal sectors that consistently fail only after some time has passed following a successful write operation, then the drive will never remap these problem sectors. * Offline Uncorrectable Sector Count: The total count of uncorrectable errors   when reading/writing a sector.

You don't judge the thoughts or become involved with     them. You simply observe and take note of any patterns.</p> <p>This practice combines concentration with awareness. You may find it helpful to focus on an object or your breath while you observe any bodily sensations, thoughts, or feelings.</p> <p>This type of meditation is good for people who don\u2019t have a teacher to guide them, as it can be easily practiced alone.</p> </li> <li> <p>Focused meditation: Involves concentration using any of the five senses.</p> <p>For example, you can focus on something internal, like your breath, or you can bring in external influences to help focus your attention.</p> <p>Try counting mala beads, listening to a gong, or staring at a candle flame.</p> <p>This practice may be simple in theory, but it can be difficult for beginners to hold their focus for longer than a few minutes at first.</p> <p>If your mind does wander, it\u2019s important to come back to the practice and refocus.</p> <p>As the name suggests, this practice is ideal for anyone who requires additional focus in their life.</p> </li> <li> <p>Movement meditation: It\u2019s an active form of meditation where the movement     guides you. It can be achieved through yoga, martial arts or by walking     through the woods, gardening, qigong, and other gentle forms of motion.</p> <p>Movement meditation is good for people who find peace in action and prefer to let their minds wander.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mantra meditation: Uses a repetitive sound to clear the mind. It can be     a word, phrase, or sound, such as the popular \u201cOm.\u201d</p> <p>It doesn't matter if your mantra is spoken loudly or quietly. After chanting the mantra for some time, you\u2019ll be more alert and in tune with your environment. This allows you to experience deeper levels of awareness.</p> <p>Some people enjoy mantra meditation because they find it easier to focus on a word than on their breath. This is also a good practice for people who don't like silence and enjoy repetition.</p> </li> <li> <p>Transcendental Meditation: It is more customizable than mantra meditation,     using a mantra or series of words that are specific to each practitioner.</p> <p>This practice is for those who like structure and are serious about maintaining a meditation practice.</p> </li> <li> <p>Progressive relaxation: Also known as body scan meditation, it's a practice     aimed at reducing tension in the body and promoting relaxation.</p> <p>Oftentimes, this form of meditation involves slowly tightening and relaxing one muscle group at a time throughout the body.</p> <p>In some cases, it may also encourage you to imagine a gentle wave flowing through your body to help release any tension.</p> <p>This form of meditation is often used to relieve stress and unwind before bedtime.</p> </li> <li> <p>Loving-kindness meditation: is used to strengthen feelings of compassion,     kindness, and acceptance toward oneself and others.</p> <p>It typically involves opening the mind to receive love from others and then sending a series of well wishes to loved ones, friends, acquaintances, and all living beings.</p> <p>Because this type of meditation is intended to promote compassion and kindness, it may be ideal for those holding feelings of anger or resentment. * Visualization meditation: Is a technique focused on enhancing feelings of relaxation, peace, and calmness by visualizing positive scenes or images.</p> <p>With this practice, it\u2019s important to imagine the scene vividly and use all five senses to add as much detail as possible.</p> <p>Another form of visualization meditation involves imagining yourself succeeding at specific goals, which is intended to increase focus and motivation.</p> <p>Many people use visualization meditation to boost their mood, reduce stress levels, and promote inner peace.</p> </li> <li> <p>Spiritual meditation: Spiritual meditation is used in Eastern religions,     such as Hinduism and Daoism, and in Christian faith..</p> <p>It\u2019s similar to prayer in that you reflect on the silence around you and seek a deeper connection with your God or Universe.</p> </li> </ul>"}, {"location": "meditation/#how-to-get-started", "title": "How to get started", "text": "<p>The easiest way to begin is to sit quietly and focus on your breath for 20 minutes every day.

I fill it up monthly to     my average monthly expenses, so I reduce the trips to the ATM to the     minimum. Once this account is below 100 EUR, I add the mental task to refill     it.</li> <li><code>Assets:Cashbox:Coins</code>: Coins stored at home. I keep it at 10 EUR in     coins of 2 EUR, so it's quick to count at the same time as it's able to     cover most of the things you need to buy with coins.</li> <li><code>Assets:Cashbox:SmallCoins</code>: If my coins wallet is starting to get heavy,     I extract the coins smaller than 50 cents into a container with copper     coins.</li> <li><code>Assets:CashDeposit</code>: You never know when the bank system is going to fuck     you, so it's always good to have some cash under the mattress.</li> </ul> <p>Having this level of granularity and doing weekly balances of each of those accounts has helped me understand the flaws in my processes that lead to the cash accounting errors.</p> <p>As most humans living in the first world, I'm forced to have at least one bank account.

As it is exposed to all the payment platforms, I assume     that it will come a time when a vulnerability is found in one of them, so     I keep the least amount of money I can. As with the <code>Cashbox</code> I monthly     refill it with the expected expenses amount plus a safety amount.</li> <li> <p><code>Assets:Savings</code>: The bank account where I store my savings. I have it     subdivided in three sections:</p> <ul> <li><code>Assets:Savings:CashFlowRefiller</code>: Here I store the average monthly     expenses for the following two months.</li> <li><code>Assets:Savings:UnexpectedExpenses</code>: Deposit for unexpected expenses such     as car or domestic appliances repairs.</li> <li><code>Assets:Savings:Home</code>: Deposit for the initial payment or a house.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"}, {"location": "money_management/#debts", "title": "Debts", "text": "<p>Debts can be tracked either as an asset or as a liability.

You'll be able to create communities, and invite users to them, they will be able to link a \"wallabag\" tag with a specific community channel.

They also use a lot of space, as many virtualenvs have their own copy of the same libraries. They help us isolate project dependencies though, but things get tricky when it comes to nested venvs. One installs the virtualenv manager(like Pipenv or Poetry) using a venv encapsulated Python, and creates more venvs using the tool which is based on an encapsulated Python. One day a minor release of Python is out and one has to check all those venvs and upgrade them if required before they can safely delete the out-dated Python version.</p> <p>Another scenario is global tools. There are many tools that are not tied to any specific virtualenv and are supposed to work with each of them. Examples are profiling tools and third-party REPLs. We also wish them to be installed in their own isolated environments. It's impossible to make them work with virtualenv, even if you have activated the virtualenv of the target project you want to work on because the tool is lying in its own virtualenv and it can only see the libraries installed in it. So we have to install the tool for each project.</p> <p>The solution has been existing for a long time. PEP 582 was originated in 2018 and is still a draft proposal till the time I copied this article.</p> <p>Say you have a project with the following structure:</p> <pre><code>.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 __pypackages__\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 3.8\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 lib\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 my_script.py\n</code></pre> <p>As specified in the PEP 582, if you run <code>python3.8 /path/to/my_script.py</code>, <code>__pypackages__/3.8/lib</code> will be added to <code>sys.path</code>, and the libraries inside will become import-able in <code>my_script.py</code>.</p> <p>Now let's review the two problems mentioned above under PEP 582. For the first problem, the main cause is that the virtual environment is bound to a cloned Python interpreter on which the subsequent library searching based. It takes advantage of Python's existing mechanisms without any other complex changes but makes the entire virtual environment to become unavailable when the Python interpreter is stale. With the local packages directory, you don't have a Python interpreter any more, the library path is directly appended to <code>sys.path</code>, so you can freely move and copy it.</p> <p>For the second, once again, you just call the tool against the project you want to analyze, and the <code>__pypackages__</code> sitting inside the project will be loaded automatically. This way you only need to keep one copy of the global tool and make it work with multiple projects.</p> <p><code>pdm</code> installs dependencies into the local package directory <code>__package__</code> and makes Python interpreters aware of it with a very simple setup.</p>"}, {"location": "pdm/#how-we-make-pep-582-packages-available-to-the-python-interpreter", "title": "How we make PEP 582 packages available to the Python interpreter", "text": "<p>Thanks to the site packages loading on Python startup.

Contrary to the common understanding, the PSU does not supply power to the computer; it instead converts the AC (Alternating Current) power from the source to the DC (Direct Current) power that the computer needs.</p> <p>There are two types of PSU: Linear and Switch-mode. Linear power supplies have a built-in transformer that steps down the voltage from the main to a usable one for the individual parts of the computer. The transformer makes the Linear PSU bulky, heavy, and expensive. Modern computers have switched to the switch-mode power supply, using switches instead of a transformer for voltage regulation. They\u2019re also more practical and economical to use because they\u2019re smaller, lighter, and cheaper than linear power supplies.</p> <p>PSU need to deliver at least the amount of power that each component requires, if it needs to deliver more, it simply won't work.</p> <p>Another puzzling question for most consumers is, \u201cDoes a PSU supply constant wattage to the computer?\u201d The answer is a flat No. The wattage you see on the PSUs casing or labels only indicates the maximum power it can supply to the system, theoretically. For example, by theory, a 500W PSU can supply a maximum of 500W to the computer. In reality, the PSU will draw a small portion of the power for itself and distributes power to each of the PC components according to its need. The amount of power the components need varies from 3.3V to 12V. If the total power of the components needs to add up to 250W, it would only use 250W of the 500W, giving you an overhead for additional components or future upgrades.</p> <p>Additionally, the amount of power the PSU supplies varies during peak periods and idle times. When the components are pushed to their limits, say when a video editor maximizes the GPU for graphics-intensive tasks, it would require more power than when the computer is used for simple tasks like web-browsing. The amount of power drawn from the PSU would depend on two things; the amount of power each component requires and the tasks that each component performs.</p>"}, {"location": "psu/#power-supply-efficiency", "title": "Power supply efficiency", "text": "<p>When PSU converts the AC power to DC, some of the power is wasted and is converted to heat.

They also draw more power from the primary source resulting in higher electricity bills for consumers.</p> <p>You might\u2019ve seen 80 PLUS stickers on PSUs or its other variants like 80 PLUS Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Titanium. 80 PLUS is the power supply\u2019s efficiency rating; the power supply must reach 80% efficiency to be certified. It\u2019s a voluntary standard, which means companies don\u2019t need to abide by the standard, but 80 PLUS certifications have become popular because a more efficient power supply can lessen the consumers\u2019 carbon footprint and help them save some bucks on their electric bills.

It means it will draw additional power from the primary source to only 20% of power is lost or generated as heat during the conversion. A 500W PSU will therefore draw 625W of power from the main to make it 80% efficient.</p> <p>Higher efficiency also means the internal components are subjected to less heat and are likely to have a longer lifespan.

Several power supply sellers have     calculators that will give you a rough estimate of your system's power needs.

This is why the latest 12+4 pin connector     that the upcoming generation graphics cards will use will provide up to 600     W of power. Currently, a pair of PCIe 6+2 pin connectors on dedicated cables     are officially rated for up to 300W, and three of these connectors can     deliver up to 450W safely. You should also add the up to 75W that the PCIe     slot can provide in these numbers.</p> <p>What troubles today's power supplies is not the maximum sustained power consumption of a GPU but its power spikes, and this is why various manufacturers suggest strong PSUs for high-end graphics cards. If the PSU's over current and over power protection features are conservatively set, the PSU can shut down once the graphics card asks for increased power, even for very short periods ( nanoseconds range). This is why EVGA offers two different OPP features in its G6 and P6 units, called firmware and hardware OPP. The first triggers at lower loads, in the millisecond range, while the latter triggers at higher loads that last for some nanoseconds. This way, short power spikes from the graphics card are addressed without shutting down the system.</p> <p>If you add the increased power demands of modern high-end CPUs, you can quickly figure out why strong PSUs are necessary again. Please look at our GPU Benchmarks and CPU Benchmarks hierarchies to see how each of these chips perform relative to each other.</p> </li> <li> <p>Check the physical dimensions of your case before buying: If you have     a standard ATX case, whether or not it is one of the best PC cases, an ATX     power supply will fit. But many higher-wattage PSUs are longer than the     typical 5.5 inches. So you'll want to be sure of your cases' PSU clearance.     If you have an exceptionally small or slim PC case, it may require a less     typical (and more compact) SFX power supply.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider a modular power supply: If your case has lots of room behind the     motherboard, or your chassis doesn't have a window or glass side, you can     cable-wrap the wires you don't' need and stash them inside your rig. But if     the system you're' building doesn't' have space for this, or there is no     easy place to hide your cable mess, it's' worth paying extra for a modular     power supply.

This also enables autoescaping for HTML and XML files.</p> <p>To load a template from this environment you just have to call the get_template() method which then returns the loaded Template:</p> <pre><code>template = env.get_template('mytemplate.html')\n</code></pre> <p>To render it with some variables, just call the <code>render()</code> method:</p> <pre><code>print(template.render(the='variables', go='here'))\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#template-guidelines", "title": "Template guidelines", "text": ""}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#variables", "title": "Variables", "text": "<p>Reference variables using <code>{{ braces }}</code> notation.</p>"}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#iterationloops", "title": "Iteration/Loops", "text": "<p>One in each line:</p> <pre><code>{% for host in groups['tag_Function_logdb'] %}\nelasticsearch_discovery_zen_ping_unicast_hosts = {{ host }}:9300\n{% endfor %}\n</code></pre> <p>Inline:</p> <pre><code>ALLOWED_HOSTS = [{% for domain in domains %}\" {{ domain }}\",{% endfor %}]\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#get-the-counter-of-the-iteration", "title": "Get the counter of the iteration", "text": "<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from jinja2 import Template\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = \"{% for element in elements %}{{loop.index}} {% endfor %}\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Template(s).render(elements=[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"])\n1 2 3 4\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#lookup", "title": "Lookup", "text": ""}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#get-environmental-variable", "title": "Get environmental variable", "text": "<pre><code>lookup('env','HOME')\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#join", "title": "Join", "text": "<pre><code>lineinfile: dest=/etc/hosts line=\"{{ item.ip }} {{ item.aliases|join(' ') }}\"\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#map", "title": "Map", "text": "<p>Get elements of a dictionary</p> <pre><code>  set_fact: asg_instances=\"{{ instances.results | map(attribute='instances') | map('first') | map(attribute='public_ip_address') | list}}\"\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#default", "title": "Default", "text": "<p>Set default value of variable</p> <pre><code>name: 'lol'\nnew_name: \"{{ name | default('trol') }}\"\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#rejectattr", "title": "Rejectattr", "text": "<p>Exclude elements from a list.</p> <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified attribute of each object, and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding.</p> <p>If no test is specified, the attribute's value will be evaluated as a boolean.</p> <pre><code>{{ users|rejectattr(\"is_active\") }}\n{{ users|rejectattr(\"email\", \"none\") }}\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#regex", "title": "Regex", "text": "<pre><code>{{ 'ansible' | regex_replace('^a.*i(.*)$', 'a\\\\1') }}\n{{ 'foobar' | regex_replace('^f.*o(.*)$', '\\\\1') }}\n{{ 'localhost:80' | regex_replace('^(?P&lt;host&gt;.+):(?P&lt;port&gt;\\\\d+)$', '\\\\g&lt;host&gt;, \\\\g&lt;port&gt;') }}\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#slice-string", "title": "Slice string", "text": "<pre><code>{{ variable_name[:-8] }}\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#conditional", "title": "Conditional", "text": ""}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#conditional-variable-definition", "title": "Conditional variable definition", "text": "<pre><code>{{ 'Update' if files else 'Continue' }}\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#check-if-variable-is-defined", "title": "Check if variable is defined", "text": "<pre><code>{% if variable is defined %}\nVariable: {{ variable }} defined\n{% endif %}\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#with-two-statements", "title": "With two statements:", "text": "<pre><code>{% if (backend_environment == 'backend' and environment == 'Dev'): %}\n\n{% elif ... %}\n{% else %}\n{% endif %}\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#extract-extension-from-file", "title": "Extract extension from file", "text": "<pre><code>s3_object        : code/frontal/vodafone-v8.18.81.zip\nremote_clone_dir : \"{{deploy_dir}}/{{ s3_object | basename | splitext | first}}\"\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#comments", "title": "Comments", "text": "<p><code>{# comment here #}</code></p>"}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#inheritance", "title": "Inheritance", "text": "<p>For simple inclusions use <code>include</code> for more complex <code>extend</code>.</p>"}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#include", "title": "Include", "text": "<p>To include a snippet from another file you can use <pre><code>{% include '_post.html' %}\n</code></pre></p>"}, {"location": "python_jinja2/#extend", "title": "Extend", "text": "<p>To inherit from another document you can use the <code>block</code> control statement.

This is by design, it ensures that your project does not break     because of unexpected changes in dependencies.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The current project is installed in editable mode by default.</p> <p>If you don't want the development requirements use the <code>--no-dev</code> flag.</p> <p>To remove the untracked dependencies that are no longer in the lock file, use <code>--remove-untracked</code>.</p>"}, {"location": "python_poetry/#updating-dependencies-to-their-latest-versions", "title": "Updating dependencies to their latest versions", "text": "<p>The <code>poetry.lock</code> file prevents you from automatically getting the latest versions of your dependencies. To update to the latest versions, use the <code>update</code> command. This will fetch the latest matching versions (according to your <code>pyproject.toml</code> file) and update the lock file with the new versions. (This is equivalent to deleting the <code>poetry.lock</code> file and running <code>install</code> again.)</p> <p>The main problem is that <code>poetry add</code> does upper pinning of dependencies by default, which is a really bad idea. And they don't plan to change.</p> <p>There is currently no way of updating your <code>pyproject.toml</code> dependency definitions so they match the latest version beyond your constrains. So if you have constrained a package to be <code>&lt;2.0.0</code> and <code>3.0.0</code> is out there, you will have to manually edit the <code>pyproject.toml</code> so that it accepts that new version.  There is no automatic process that does this. At least you can use <code>poetry show --outdated</code> and it will tell you which is the new version, and if the output is zero, you're sure you're on the last versions.</p> <p>Some workarounds exists though, if you run <code>poetry add dependency@latest</code> it will update the lock to the latest. MousaZeidBaker made poetryup, a tool that is able to update the requirements to the latest version with <code>poetryup --latest</code> (although it still has some bugs).

For example we could:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use an external monitor: Your laptop's screen is usually not big enough and     will force you to look down instead of look straight which can lead to neck     pain. Some prefer super big monitors (48 inches) while others feel that 24     inches is more than enough so you don't have to turn your head to reach each     side of the screen. For me the sweet spot is having two terminals with 100     characters of width one beside the other. If you use a tiling window manager     like i3wm, that should be enough.</p> <p>Some people valued that the screen was not fixed, so it could be tilted or it's height could be changed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adjust the screen to your eye level: The center of the monitor should be at     eye level, if the monitor height adjustment is not enough, you can use some     old books or buy a screen support.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use an external keyboard: Sometimes the keys of the laptop keyboards have     a cheap feedback or a weird key disposition, which leads to finger and wrist     aches.  The use of an external keyboard (better if it's a mechanical one)     can help with this issue.</p> </li> <li> <p>The chair should support your back and don't be too hard to hurt your butt, nor too     soft.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your legs should not be hanging in the air, that will add unnecessary pressure on your     thighs which can lead to tingling. If you're in this situation, a leg     support comes handy.</p> <p>The legs shouldn't be crossed either in front or below you, they should be straight with a 90 degree angle between your thighs and your calves, with a waist level separation between the feet.</p> </li> <li> <p>The table height should be enough to have a 90 degree angle between your     forearms and your biceps , and your shoulders are in a relaxed stance. Small     people may need a table with no drawers between your elbows and your legs,     or you wont be able to fulfill the arm's requirement.</p> <p>The table height should be low enough to fulfill the leg's requirement above. Sometimes they are too high to be able to have a 90 degree angle between the thighs and calves even with feet support, in that case, change the desk or cut it's legs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Think about using a standing desk. Desk's with variable height are quite     expensive, but there is always the option to buy a laptop support that let's     you stand.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your hands should be at the same level as your forearms, you could use a wrist     support for that and also to soften the contact of your forearms with the     desk.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you're a heavy mouse user, think of using a vertical mouse instead of the     traditional to prevent the metacarpal syndrome.

You have to define in your library documentation what the deprecation period is. For example, NumPy and Python use three minor releases.

The deprecation period ensures the \u201cnext\u201d version works, which is really useful, and usually gives you time to adjust before the removal happens.

For instance, if you are doing SemVer then your <code>X.Y.Z</code> version maps a branch to <code>X.Y</code> branch where you're doing your current feature work, an <code>X.Y.Z+1</code> branch for any bugfixes, and potentially an <code>X+1.0.0</code> branch where you doing some crazy new stuff. So you got your next branch, main branch, and bugfix branch. And all three of those branches are alive and receiving updates.</p> <p>For projects that have those 3 kinds of branches going, the concept of SemVer makes much more sense, but how many projects are doing that? You have to be a pretty substantial project typically to have the throughput to justify that much project overhead.</p> <p>There are a lot more projects that have a single <code>bugfix</code> branch and a <code>main</code> branch which has all feature work, whether it be massively backwards-incompatible or not. In that case why carry around two version numbers? This is how you end up with ZeroVer. If you're doing that why not just drop a digit and have your version be <code>X.Y</code>? PEP 440 supports it, and it would more truthfully represent your branching strategy appropriately in your version number. However, most library maintainers/developers out there don\u2019t have enough resources to maintain even two branches.</p> <p>Maintaining a library is very time-consuming, and most libraries have just a few active maintainers available that maintain other many libraries. To complicate matters even further, for most maintainers this is not a full-time job, but something on the side, part of their free time.</p> <p>Given the scarce human resources to maintain a library, in practice, there\u2019s a single supported version for any library at any given point in time: the latest one. Any version before that (be that major, minor, patch) is in essence abandoned:</p> <ul> <li>If you want security updates, you need to move to the latest version.</li> <li>If you want a bug to be fixed, you need to move to the newest version.</li> <li>If you want a new feature, it is only going to be available in the latest     version.</li> </ul> <p>If the only maintained version is the latest, you really just have an <code>X</code> version number that is monotonically increasing. Once again PEP 440 supports it, so why not! It still communicates your branch strategy of there being only a single branch at any one time. Now I know this is a bit too unconventional for some people, and you may get into the high version number problem, then maybe it makes sense to use calendar versioning to use the version number to indicate the release date to signify just how old of a version you\u2019re using, but if stuff is working does that really matter?</p>"}, {"location": "semantic_versioning/#high-version-numbers", "title": "High version numbers", "text": "<p>Another major argument is that people inherently judge a project based on what it\u2019s version number is. They\u2019ll implicitly assume that <code>foo 2.0</code> is better than <code>bar 1.0</code> (and <code>frob 3.0</code> is better still) because the version numbers are higher. However, there is a limit to this, if you go too high too quickly, people assume your project is unstable and shouldn\u2019t really be used, even if the reason that your project is so high is because you removed some tiny edge cases that nobody actually used and didn\u2019t actually impact many people, if any, at all.</p> <p>These are two different expressions of the same thing. The first is that people will look down on a project for not having a high enough version compared to its competitors. While it\u2019s true that some people will do this, it's not a significant reason to throw away the communication benefits of your version number. Ultimately, no matter what you do, people who judge a project as inferior because of something as shallow as \u201csmaller version number\u201d will find some other, equally shallow, reason to pick between projects.</p> <p>The other side of this is a bit different. When you have a large major version, like <code>42.0.0</code>, people assume that your library is not stable and that you regularly break compatibility and if you follow SemVer strictly, it does actually mean that you regularly break compatibility.</p> <p>There are two general cases:</p> <ul> <li>The true positives: where a project that does routinely break it\u2019s public API in meaningful ways.</li> <li>The false positives: Projects that strictly follow semantic versioning were     each change which is not backwards compatible requires bumping a major     version. This means that if you remove some function that nobody actually     uses you need to increase your major version. Do it again and you need to     increase your major version again. Do this enough times, for even very small     changes and you can quickly get into a large version number <code>6</code>. This case     is a false positive for the \u201cstability\u201d test, because the reality is that     your project is actually quite stable.</li> </ul>"}, {"location": "semantic_versioning/#difference-in-change-categorization", "title": "Difference in change categorization", "text": "<p>Here's a thought experiment: you need to add a new warning to your Python package that tries to follow SemVer.

You might think it's a minor version bump because it isn't exactly a bugfix. And you might think it's a major version bump because if you ran your Python code with <code>-W</code> error you suddenly introduced a new exception which could break people's code.

Because in Python we can't statically define what an API change is there will always be a disagreement between you and your dependencies as to what a \"feature\" or \"bugfix\" truly is.</p> <p>That builds one of the arguments for CalVer.

They were called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM). Later, NREM sleep was further subdivided into four separate stages, named from 1 to 4 (all awful names <code>(\u0482\u2323\u0300_\u2323\u0301)</code>). Stages 3 and 4 are the deepest stages of NREM sleep, meaning that it's more difficult to wake you up in comparison with stages 1 and 2.</p> <p>In REM sleep, your eyes rapidly move from side to side underneath the lids. This movement are accompanied by active brainwaves, almost identical to those observed when you are awake. On the other hand, eyes remain still and the brainwaves also calm down in the NREM phases.</p> <p></p> <p>Even though we switch from sleep phases each 90 minutes, the ratio of NREM to REM sleep throughout the night changes across the night. In the first half of the night, the vast majority of time is spent in deep NREM and very little REM. But as we transition through the second half of the night, REM starts dominating.</p> <p>Although there is no scientific consensus, the need to remodel and update our neural circuits at night can explain this repeatable but asymmetric pattern. Throughout the day, the new memories are stored in the RAM of your brain, when you start to sleep, the brain needs to move the important ones to the hard drive, for long term retrieval. The brain needs to solve an optimization problem:</p> <ul> <li>The hard drive and the RAM have limited capacity.</li> <li>The RAM needs to be cleaned to be able to register the next day's memories.</li> <li>The brain needs RAM to do the analysis of which memories to keep and     which to remove.</li> </ul> <p>A key function of NREM sleep is to remove unnecessary neural connections, while REM sleep plays a role in strengthening those connections. The different roles and the capacity limits explains why the brain needs to switch between them. The asymmetry can be explained with the simile of creating a sculpture from a block of clay. At the beginning of the night, the long phases of NREM extensively removes unneeded material, with short REM phases to define the basic form. With each cycle, less material needs to be strongly removed and more enhancing of the details is required, thus the increase of REM sleep.</p> <p>A danger resides in this sleep profile. Since your brain desires most of its REM sleep in the last part of the night, if you wake up early, sleeping 6 hours instead of 8, you can be losing between 60 to 90% of all your REM sleep, even though you are losing 25% of your total sleep time. It works both ways, if you instead go to sleep two hours late, you'll loose a significant amount of deep NREM sleep.

While you loose your conscious mapping during sleep, at a non-conscious level, the brain keeps track of time with incredible precision. To distort it even more, you sense a time dilation in dreams.

It is important that oral hygiene be carried out on a regular basis to enable prevention of dental disease and bad breath. The most common types of dental disease are tooth decay (cavities, dental caries) and gum diseases, including gingivitis, and periodontitis.</p> <p>General guidelines suggest brushing twice a day: after breakfast and before going to bed, but ideally the mouth would be cleaned after every meal. Cleaning between the teeth is called interdental cleaning and is as important as tooth brushing. This is because a toothbrush cannot reach between the teeth and therefore only removes about 50% of plaque from the surface of the teeth. There are many tools to clean between the teeth, including floss and interdental brushes; it is up to each individual to choose which tool they prefer to use.</p> <p>Over 80% of cavities occur inside fissures in teeth where brushing cannot reach food left trapped after eating and saliva and fluoride have no access to neutralize acid and remineralize demineralized teeth, unlike easy-to-clean parts of the tooth, where fewer cavities occur.</p>"}, {"location": "teeth/#teeth-brushing", "title": "Teeth brushing", "text": "<p>Routine tooth brushing is the principal method of preventing many oral diseases, and perhaps the most important activity an individual can practice to reduce dental plaque and tartar.</p> <p>The dental plaque contains a mixture of bacteria, their acids and sticky byproducts and food remnants. It forms naturally on teeth immediately after you've eaten but doesn't get nasty and start to cause damage to the teeth until it reaches a certain stage of maturity. The exact amount of time this takes isn't known but is at least more than 12 hours.</p> <p>Bacteria consume sugar and, as a byproduct, produce acids which dissolve mineral out of the teeth, leaving microscopic holes we can't see. If the process isn't stopped and they aren't repaired, these can become big, visible cavities.</p> <p>So controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from plaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries.</p> <p>Many oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for a minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day, but ideally after each meal.</p> <p>Toothbrushing can only clean to a depth of about 1.5 mm inside the gingival pockets, but a sustained regime of plaque removal above the gum line can affect the ecology of the microbes below the gums and may reduce the number of pathogens in pockets up to 5 mm in depth.</p> <p>Toothpaste (dentifrice) with fluoride, or alternatives such as nano-hydroxyapatite, is an important tool to readily use when tooth brushing. The fluoride (or alternatives) in the dentifrice is an important protective factor against caries, and an important supplement needed to remineralize already affected enamel. However, in terms of preventing gum disease, the use of toothpaste does not increase the effectiveness of the activity with respect to the amount of plaque removed. People use toothpaste with nano-hydroxyapatite instead of fluoride as it performs the same function, and some people believe fluoride in toothpaste is a neurotoxin.</p> <p>For maximum benefit, use toothpaste with 1350-1500 ppmF (that's concentration of fluoride in parts per million) to prevent tooth decay.</p> <p>At night, you produce less saliva than during the day. Because of this, your teeth have less protection from saliva and are more vulnerable to acid attacks. That's why it's important to remove food from your teeth before bed so plaque bacteria can't feast overnight. Don't eat or drink anything except water after brushing at night.

One technique that can be used to access these areas is dental floss. When the proper technique is used, flossing can remove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and below the gums. The American Dental Association (ADA) reports that up to 80% of plaque may be removed by this method. The ADA recommends cleaning between the teeth as part of one's daily oral hygiene regime, with a different piece of floss at each flossing session.</p> <p>The correct technique to ensure maximum plaque removal is as follows: (1, 2)</p> <ul> <li>Floss length: 15\u201325 cm wrapped around middle fingers.</li> <li>For upper teeth grasp the floss with thumb and index finger, for lower teeth     with both index fingers. Ensure that a length of roughly 2.5cm is left     between the fingers.</li> <li>Ease the floss gently between the teeth using a back and forth motion. Do not     snap the floss into the gums.</li> <li>When the floss reaches your gumline, curve it into a C-shape against a tooth     until you feel resistance.</li> <li>Hold the floss against the tooth. Gently scrape the side of the tooth, moving     the floss away from the gum. Repeat on the other side of the gap, along the     side of the next tooth.</li> <li>Do not forget the back of your last tooth.</li> <li>Ensure that the floss is taken below the gum margins using a back and forth up     and down motion.</li> </ul> <p>You should floss before brushing your teeth because any food, plaque, and bacteria released by flossing are removed by the afterwards brushing.</p> <p>Another tips regarding flossing are:</p> <ul> <li>Skip the toothpick: Use floss instead of a toothpick to remove food stuck in between your teeth. Using a toothpick can damage your gums and lead to an infection.</li> <li>Be gentle: Don't be too aggressive when flossing to avoid bleeding gums.</li> </ul> <p>When you first start flossing, your gums may be tender and bleed a little.

It is a part of non-surgical periodontal therapy.

Those bacteria mix with other substances to form sticky plaque on teeth, which is mostly banished by regular brushing and flossing.</p> <p></p> <p>Plaques that don't get brushed away can harden and form a substance known as tartar, which can only be removed with a dental cleaning. When tartar remains on the teeth, it can cause inflammation of the gums, a condition called gingivitis, characterized by red swollen gums that can bleed easily. A mild form of gum disease, gingivitis can usually be reversed through regular brushing and flossing along with cleanings by a dentist or hygienist.</p> <p></p> <p>If gingivitis isn't cured, it can advance to a more severe form of gum disease called periodontitis, in which the inflamed tissue begins to pull away from the teeth, forming spaces, or pockets. As the pockets become deeper, more of the tooth below the gum line is exposed to bacteria, which can damage the bone holding teeth in place.</p> <p>Eventually, if the pockets become deep enough, teeth can become loose and may even be lost. Dentists measure the depth of the pockets with a probe that has a tiny ruler on the end.

A Cochrane review by Worthington et al. in 2013 considered only scaling and polishing of the teeth, but not root planing. After examining 88 papers they found only three studies that met all their requirements, remarking that \"the quality of the evidence was generally low.\"</p> <p>An extensive review that did involve root planing was published by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health in 2016. It made a number of findings, including (1) In five randomized controlled trials, scaling and root planing \"was associated with a decrease in plaque from baseline at one month, three months, or six months;\" and (2) Four studies analyzed changes in the gingival index (GI) from the baseline and \"found a significant improvement from baseline in the scaling and root planing group at three months and six months.\" This study also discussed evidence-based guidelines for frequency of scaling with and without root planing for patients both with and without chronic periodontitis. The group that produced one of the main systematic reviews used in the 2016 Canadian review has published guidelines based on its findings. They recommend that scaling and root planing (SRP) should be considered as the initial treatment for patients with chronic periodontitis. They note that \"the strength of the recommendation is limited because SRP is considered the reference standard and thus used as an active control for periodontal trials and there are few studies in which investigators compare SRP with no treatment.\" They add however that \"root planing ... carries the risk of damaging the root surface and potentially causing tooth or root sensitivity. Generally expected post-SRP procedural adverse effects include discomfort.\"</p> <p>Enamel cracks, early caries and resin restorations can be damaged during scaling.</p>"}, {"location": "teeth_deep_cleaning/#effectiveness-of-the-procedure", "title": "Effectiveness of the procedure", "text": "<p>A scaling and root planing procedure is to be considered effective if the patient is subsequently able to maintain their periodontal health without further bone or attachment loss and if it prevents recurrent infection with periodontal pathogens.</p> <p>The long term effectiveness of scaling and root planing depends upon a number of factors. These factors include patient compliance, disease progress at the time of intervention, probing depth, and anatomical factors like grooves in the roots of teeth, concavities, and furcation involvement which may limit visibility of underlying deep calculus and debris.</p> <p>First and foremost, periodontal scaling and root planing is a procedure that must be done thoroughly and with attention to detail in order to ensure complete removal of all calculus and plaque from involved sites. If these causative agents are not removed, the disease will continue to progress and further damage will result. In cases of mild to moderate periodontitis, scaling and root planing can achieve excellent results if the procedure is thorough. As periodontitis increases in severity, a greater amount of supporting bone is destroyed by the infection. This is illustrated clinically by the deepening of the periodontal pockets targeted for cleaning and disinfection during the procedure. Once the periodontal pockets exceed 6 mm in depth, the effectiveness of deposit removal begins to decrease, and the likelihood of complete healing after one procedure begins to decline as well. The more severe the infection prior to intervention, the greater the effort required to arrest its progress and return the patient to health. Diseased pockets over 6 mm can be resolved through periodontal flap surgery.</p> <p>Although healing of the soft tissues will begin immediately following removal of the microbial biofilm and calculus that cause the disease, scaling and root planing is only the first step in arresting the disease process. Following initial cleaning and disinfection of all affected sites, it is necessary to prevent the infection from recurring. Therefore, patient compliance is, by far, the most important factor, having the greatest influence on the success or failure of periodontal intervention. Immediately following treatment, the patient will need to maintain excellent oral care at home. With proper homecare, which includes but is by no means limited to brushing twice daily for 2\u20133 minutes, flossing daily and use of mouthrinse, the potential for effective healing following scaling and root planing increases. Commitment to and diligence in the thorough completion of daily oral hygiene practices are essential to this success.</p> <p>The process which allows for the formation of deep periodontal pockets does not occur overnight. Therefore, it is unrealistic to expect the tissue to heal completely in a similarly short time period. Gains in gingival attachment may occur slowly over time, and ongoing periodontal maintenance visits are usually recommended (by some sources).</p>"}, {"location": "teeth_deep_cleaning/#side-effects", "title": "Side effects", "text": "<p>The process carries it's risks, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Pop out a filling</li> <li>Gums damage in an irreversible way.</li> <li>End up with an abscess if a tiny piece of tartar is knocked loose and becomes     trapped.</li> <li>Have more sensitivity after the procedure.</li> </ul>"}, {"location": "teeth_deep_cleaning/#conclusion", "title": "Conclusion", "text": "<ul> <li>Deep cleaning is an invasive procedure</li> <li>There is a lack of scientific studies supporting the frequency of it's     application, specially for people that doesn't suffer from periodontitis.</li> <li>It's an expensive procedure.</li> </ul> <p>So, ask the opinion of two or three independent dentists before doing a deep clean.</p>"}, {"location": "tenacity/", "title": "Tenacity", "text": "<p>Tenacity is an Apache 2.0 licensed general-purpose retrying library, written in Python, to simplify the task of adding retry behavior to just about anything.</p>"}, {"location": "tenacity/#installation", "title": "Installation", "text": "<pre><code>pip install tenacity\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "tenacity/#usage", "title": "Usage", "text": "<p>Tenacity isn't api compatible with retrying but adds significant new functionality and fixes a number of longstanding bugs.</p> <p>The simplest use case is retrying a flaky function whenever an Exception occurs until a value is returned.</p> <pre><code>import random\nfrom tenacity import retry\n\n@retry\ndef do_something_unreliable():\n    if random.randint(0, 10) &gt;

By default, this is a terraform.tfstate file that is automatically generated in the folder where you ran terraform apply. </p> <p>That means that the secrets will end up in terraform.tfstate in plain text! This has been an open issue for more than 6 years now, with no clear plans for a first-class solution. There are some workarounds out there that can scrub secrets from your state files, but these are brittle and likely to break with each new Terraform release, so I don\u2019t recommend them.</p> <p>For the time being, you can:</p> <ul> <li>Store Terraform state in a backend that supports encryption: Instead of storing your state in a local <code>terraform.tfstate</code> file, Terraform natively supports a variety of backends, such as S3, GCS, and Azure Blob Storage. Many of these backends support encryption, so that instead of your state files being in plain text, they will always be encrypted, both in transit (e.g., via TLS) and on disk (e.g., via AES-256). Most backends also support collaboration features (e.g., automatically pushing and pulling state; locking), so using a backend is a must-have both from a security and teamwork perspective.</li> <li>Strictly control who can access your Terraform backend: Since Terraform state files may contain secrets, you\u2019ll want to carefully control who has access to the backend you\u2019re using to store your state files. For example, if you\u2019re using S3 as a backend, you\u2019ll want to configure an IAM policy that solely grants access to the S3 bucket for production to a small handful of trusted devs (or perhaps solely just the CI server you use to deploy to prod).</li> </ul> <p>There are several approaches here.</p> <p>First rely on the S3 encryption to protect the information in your state file.</p> <p>Second, use Vault provider to protect the state file.</p> <p>Third (but I won't use it) would be to use terrahelp</p>"}, {"location": "terraform/#sensitive-information-in-the-terraform-source-code", "title": "Sensitive information in the Terraform source code", "text": "<p>To store secrets in your source code you can:</p> <ul> <li>Use Secret Stores</li> <li>Use environment variables</li> <li>Use encrypted files</li> </ul> <p>Using Secret Stores is the best solution, but for that you'd need access and trust in a Secret Store provider which I don't have at the moment (if you want to follow this path check out Hashicorp Vault). Using environment variables is the worst solution because this technique helps you avoid storing secrets in plain text in your code, but it leaves the question of how to actually securely store and manage the secrets unanswered. So in a sense, this technique just kicks the can down the road, whereas the other techniques described later are more prescriptive. Although you could use a password manager such as <code>pass</code>. Using encrypted files is the solution that remains.</p> <p>If you don't want to install a secret store and are used to work with GPG, you can encrypt the secrets, store the cipher text in a file, and checking that file into the version control system. To encrypt some data, such as some secrets in a file, you need an encryption key. This key is itself a secret! This creates a bit of a conundrum: how do you securely store that key? You can\u2019t check the key into version control as plain text, as then there\u2019s no point of encrypting anything with it. You could encrypt the key with another key, but then you then have to figure out where to store that second key. So you\u2019re back to the \u201ckick the can down the road problem,\u201d as you still have to find a secure way to store your encryption key. Although you can use external solutions such as AWS KMS or GCP KMS we don't want to store that kind of information on big companies servers. A local and more beautiful way is to rely on PGP to do the encryption.</p> <p>We'll use then <code>sops</code> a Mozilla tool for managing secrets that can use PGP behind the scenes. <code>sops</code> can automatically decrypt a file when you open it in your text editor, so you can edit the file in plain text, and when you go to save those files, it automatically encrypts the contents again. </p> <p>Terraform does not yet have native support for decrypting files in the format used by <code>sops</code>. One solution is to install and use the custom provider for sops, <code>terraform-provider-sops</code>. Another option, is to use Terragrunt. To avoid installing more tools, it's better to use the terraform provider.</p> <p>First of all you may need to install <code>sops</code>, you can grab the latest release from their downloads page.</p> <p>Then in your terraform code you need to select the <code>sops</code> provider:</p> <pre><code>terraform {\n  required_providers {\n    sops = {\n      source = \"carlpett/sops\"\n      version = \"~&gt; 0.5\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Configure <code>sops</code> by defining the gpg keys in a <code>.sops.yaml</code> file at the top of your repository:</p> <pre><code>---\ncreation_rules:\n- pgp: &gt;-\n2829BASDFHWEGWG23WDSLKGL323534J35LKWERQS,\n2GEFDBW349YHEDOH2T0GE9RH0NEORIG342RFSLHH\n</code></pre> <p>Then create the secrets file with the command <code>sops secrets.enc.json</code> somewhere in your terraform repository. For example:</p> <pre><code>{\n\"password\": \"foo\",\n\"db\": {\"password\": \"bar\"}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You'll be able to use these secrets in your terraform code. For example:</p> <pre><code>data \"sops_file\" \"secrets\" {\n  source_file = \"secrets.enc.json\"\n}\n\noutput \"root-value-password\" {\n  # Access the password variable from the map\n  value = data.sops_file.secrets.data[\"password\"]\n}\n\noutput \"mapped-nested-value\" {\n  # Access the password variable that is under db via the terraform map of data\n  value = data.sops_file.secrets.data[\"db.password\"]\n}\n\noutput \"nested-json-value\" {\n  # Access the password variable that is under db via the terraform object\n  value = jsondecode(data.sops_file.secrets.raw).db.password\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Sops also supports encrypting the entire file when in other formats. Such files can also be used by specifying <code>input_type = \"raw\"</code>:</p> <pre><code>data \"sops_file\" \"some-file\" {\n  source_file = \"secret-data.txt\"\n  input_type = \"raw\"\n}\n\noutput \"do-something\" {\n  value = data.sops_file.some-file.raw\n}\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "terraform/#rds-credentials", "title": "RDS credentials", "text": "<p>The RDS credentials are saved in plaintext both in the definition and in the state file, see this bug for more information.

Using time effectively gives the person \"choice\" on spending or managing activities at their own time and expediency.</p> <p>To be able to do time management, you first need to define how do you want to increase your effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity.

Therefore, we need some mechanism to encode these evolutions of the library, so that downstream users can understand how big the change is. Most commonly, developers use three methods:</p> <ul> <li>A version number.</li> <li>A changelog.</li> <li>The git history.</li> </ul> <p>The version change is used as a concise way for the project to communicate this evolution, and it's what we're going to analyze in this article. However, encoding all the information of a change into a number switch has proven to be far from perfect.</p> <p>That's why keeping a good and detailed changelog makes a lot of sense, as it will better transmit that intent, and what will be the impact of upgrading. Once again, this falls into the same problem as before, while a change log is more descriptive, it still only tells you what changes (or breakages) a project intended to make, it doesn\u2019t go into any detail about unintended consequences of changes made. Ultimately, a change log\u2019s accuracy is no different than that of the version itself, it's just (hopefully!) more detailed.</p> <p>Fundamentally, any indicator of change that isn\u2019t a full diff is just a lossy encoding of that change. You can't expect though to read all the diffs of the libraries that you use, that's why version numbers and changelogs make a lot of sense. We just need to be aware of the limits of each system.</p> <p>That being said, you'll use version numbers in two ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>As a producer of applications and libraries where you\u2019ll have to decide what     versioning system to use.</p> </li> <li> <p>As a consumer of dependencies, you\u2019ll have to express what versions of a given library your     application/library is compatible.</p> </li> </ul>"}, {"location": "versioning/#deciding-what-version-system-to-use-for-your-programs", "title": "Deciding what version system to use for your programs", "text": "<p>The two most popular versioning systems are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Semantic Versioning: A way to define your program's     version based on the type of changes you've introduced.</p> </li> <li> <p>Calendar Versioning: A versioning convention based     on your project's release calendar, instead of arbitrary numbers.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Each has it's advantages and disadvantages. From a consumer perspective, I think that projects should generally default to SemVer-ish, following the spirit of the documentation rather than the letter of the specification because:</p> <ul> <li>Your version number becomes a means of communicating your changes intents to     your end users.</li> <li>If you use the semantic versioning commit message     guidelines, you are more     likely to have a useful git history and can automatically maintain the     project's changelog.</li> </ul> <p>There are however, corner cases where CalVer makes more sense:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You\u2019re tracking something that is already versioned using dates or for which     the version number can only really be described as a point in time release.

You should still document     this fact in your README, but if there\u2019s no promise of compatibility between     releases, then there\u2019s no information to be communicated in the version     number.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your project is never going to intentionally breaking compatibility in     a release, and you strive to always maintain compatibility. Projects can     always just use the latest version of your software. Your changes will     only ever be additive, and if you need to change your API, you\u2019ll do     something like leave the old API intact, and add a new API with the new     semantics.

Even if the library follows true SemVer perfectly, a major version bump does not promise to break downstream code. It promises that some downstream code may break. If you use <code>pytest</code> to test your code, for example, the next major version will be very unlikely to break. If you write a <code>pytest</code> extension, however, then the chances of something breaking are much higher (but not 100%, maybe not even 50%). Quite ironically, the better a package follows SemVer, the smaller the change will trigger a major version, and therefore the less likely a major version will break a particular downstream code.</p> <p>As a general rule, if you have a reasonably stable dependency, and you only use the documented API, especially if your usage is pretty light/general, then a major update is extremely unlikely to break your code. It\u2019s quite rare for light usage of a library to break on a major update. It can happen, of course, but is unlikely. If you are using something very heavily, if you are working on a framework extension, or if you use internals that are not publicly documented, then your chances of breaking on a major release are much higher.

These are libraries you\u2019re directly importing within the application/library you\u2019re maintaining, but then the libraries themselves may rely on other libraries. This is known as a transitive dependency. Very soon, you\u2019ll get to a point where two different components use the same library, and both of them might express version constraints on it.</p> <p>For example, consider the case of <code>tenacity</code>: a general-purpose retrying library. Imagine you were using this in your application, and being a religious follower of semantic versioning, you\u2019ve pinned it to the version that was out when you created the app in early 2018: <code>4.11</code>. The constraint would specify version <code>4.11</code> or later, but less than the next major version <code>5</code>.</p> <p>At the same time, you also connect to an HTTP service. This connection is handled by another library, and the maintainer of that decided to also use <code>tenacity</code> to offer automatic retry functionality. They pinned it similarly following the semantic versioning convention. Back in 2018, this caused no issues. But then August comes, and version <code>5.0</code> is released.</p> <p>The service and its library maintainers have a lot more time on their hands (perhaps because they are paid to do so), so they quickly move to version <code>5.0</code>. Or perhaps they want to use a feature from the new major version. Now they introduce the pin greater than five but less than six on tenacity. Their public interface does not change at all at this point, so they do not bump their major version. It\u2019s just a patch release.</p> <p>Python can only have one version of a library installed at a given time. At this point, there is a version conflict. You\u2019re requesting a version between four and five, while the service library is requesting a version between five and six. Both constraints cannot be satisfied.</p> <p>If you use a version of pip older than <code>20.2</code> (the release in which it added a dependency resolver) it will just install a version matching the first constraint it finds and ignore any subsequent constraints. Versions of pip after <code>20.2</code> would fail with an error indicating that the constraint cannot be satisfied.</p> <p>Either way, your application no longer works. The only way to make it work is to either pin the service library down to the last working patch number, or upgrade your version pinning of <code>tenacity</code>. This is generating extra work for you with minimal benefit. Often it might not be even possible to use two conflicting libraries until one of them relaxes their requirements. It also means you must support a wide version range; ironically. If you update to requiring `tenacity</p> <p>5<code>, your update can\u2019t be installed with another library still on</code>4.11<code>. So you have to support</code>tenacity&gt;=4.11,&lt;6` for a while until most libraries have similarly updated.</p> <p>And for those who might think this doesn\u2019t happen often, let me say that <code>tenacity</code> released another major version a year later in November 2019. Thus, the cycle starts all over again. In both cases, your code most likely did not need to change at all, as just a small part of their public API changed. In my experience, this happens a lot more often than when a major version bump breaks you.

A moderately sized application can have a hundred or more dependencies when expanded, so such issues in my experience start to appear every few months.

You can only fail. So this does not \u201cfix\u201d something by getting an older, working version, it only causes hard failures if it works the way you might hope it does. This means instead of seeing the real failure and possibly helping to fix it, users just see a <code>Python doesn\u2019t match</code> error.

When Python 4 does come out, it will be really hard to even run your CI on 4 until all your dependencies uncap. And you won\u2019t actually see the real failures, you\u2019ll just see incompatibility errors, so you won\u2019t even know what to report to those libraries. And this practice makes it hard to test development versions of Python.</p> <p>And, if you use Poetry, as soon as someone caps the Python version, every Poetry project that uses it must also cap, even if you believe it is a detestable practice and confusing to users.

They have most available unit types to recruit (8), more than any other faction.</p> <p>Loyalists are mostly melee oriented faction, with only two ranged unit types, the mage and the bowman, but their ranged units play a significant role in the loyalists strategy and have to be used effectively. About the melee troops the loyalist player gets to choose among:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Heavy Infantrymen: Few strikes, high damage per strike, slow, higher     hit-points, good resistances, low defenses, deals impact damage which is good     against undead.</p> </li> <li> <p>Spearmen: Average strikes, average damage per strike, average movement,     medium hit-points, normal resistances, average defenses, deals pierce damage     which is good against drakes, has a weak ranged attack.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fencer: High number of strikes, low damage per strike, quick, low hit-points,     bad resistances, good defenses, deals blade damage which is good against     elusive foots or wose, deals less total damage than the other two, is     a skirmisher.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The loyalists unit price ranges from the cheap spearmen and mermen (14 gold) to the expensive horsemen (23 gold).</p> <p>Loyalist units generally have good hit-points and they deal good damage, even the cheap spearmen and bowmen. Even their scouts have high hit-points and better melee attack compared to most of the scouts of the other factions. But on the other hand, the loyalist scouts have lower defenses than most of the other scouts and they do not have a ranged attack.</p> <p>The loyalists have some units with good resistances, like Heavy Infantry or Cavalryman, which can be very good for defending if you notice that your opponent doesn't have the proper units to counter them. Other units, like the bowman, who is more vulnerable than the previous two, but is also good for defense because it has better defense, is cheaper and it deals solid damage back in both melee and range. Similar goes for the spearman.</p> <p>When attacking, Loyalists have units which can be pretty devastating, like the horseman for attacking enemy mages and other ranged units, mages against the entrenched melee units, fencers for killing enemy injured and valuable units trying to heal behind their lines. But the mentioned units are also very vulnerable and they can die very easily if not properly supported.</p> <p>The loyalists as a faction generally have average defenses (they do not get 70% defense anywhere, with the exception of the fencer, which is a special case) and they are not a terrain dependent faction (like the Elves or Knalgans are). Therefore, even if it good to put spearmen and bowmen on mountains, villages and castles where they get 60% defense, you should also take the faction you are facing into account when deciding where to place your units. For example, if you are fighting Knalgans, you should try not to move your units next to hills and mountains and/or take the hills and mountains with your units and leave the forest to the dwarves.</p> <p>All the loyalist units are lawful, which obviously leads to the conclusion that the loyalists should be more aggressive and attack at day (or even start at dawn, because your opponent in most of the cases will be reluctant to attack too aggressively and leave units on bad ground when the morning arrives) while at night the loyalists should at least play conservatively, or in some cases even run away. Of course, that is also dependent upon the faction of your opponent.</p> <p>The greatest weakness of the loyalists is their limited mobility. The loyalists' units have normal movement, some of their units like the horseman, cavalryman, merman fighter and the fencer are pretty quick when they are in their favorable environment, but all their units get slowed over rough terrain a lot compared to the other factions' units . Half of the loyalists units can not even move on/over mountains, and their scouts get significantly slowed in forest, for example. This lack of mobility will often give your opponent an opportunity to outmaneuver you in the game.To prevent that, sometimes it is good to attack hard on a certain point and defend only with minimal amount of units elsewhere, rather than uniformly spreading your units around the front.</p> <p>When you don't know which faction you are facing, it is good to get a mixture of units. On most of the default 1v1 maps, this initial recruitment list would be good : spearman, bowman, fencer, mage, merman fighter, cavalryman. As always, you should carefully consider about the exact placement of each individual unit from the initial recruits on the castle to come up with the most optimal combination that will allow you the quickest village grabbing in the first turns of the game.</p>"}, {"location": "wesnoth_loyalist/#loyalists-vs-undead", "title": "Loyalists vs. Undead", "text": "<p>When fighting undead, your recruiting pattern will depend on whether your opponent spams skeleton archers or dark adepts for ranged attacks.

You might use them to poke at     walking corpses, ghouls, vampire bats and ghosts, but mages are     much better at all of these things. I would only buy a bowman to counter     a large zombie horde.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cavalryman: (B+) You'll want some cavalry for scouting and dealing     initial damage to dark adepts so that a horseman can finish them.

However, the cheap skeleton archers will really ruin     cavalry quickly at night, so if there are any skeleton archers on the other     side you won't be able to use cavalry to hold territory. If your opponent     over-recruits dark adepts, however, you can use cold-resistant cavalry to hold     territory against them. They are also decent for holding territory against     ghouls because they can run away and heal (unlike your heavy infantrymen).</p> </li> <li> <p>Fencer: (C-) Fencers are a bad recruit in this match up because they are     vulnerable to the blade and pierce damage of skeletons and cannot damage     them much in return. They also are incapable of holding territory against     dark adepts, who cut right through the high defense of fencers. However,     you may want to have a fencer or two around for trapping dark adepts or     getting in that last hit. With luck, they may also be able to frustrate     non-magical attacks from skeletons and the like.</p> </li> <li> <p>Heavy Infantryman: (B+) You need heavy infantry to hold territory     against skeletons and skeleton archers, and they will be your unit of     choice for dealing melee damage, especially to the cheap skeleton archers.     Any heavy infantrymen in the daytime can kill a full health skeleton     archer in two hits, while a strong heavy infantrymen in the daytime can     kill a full health skeleton in two hits, dealing 18 damage per strike (even     a mage in daytime cannot kill a skeleton in one round, unless supported by     a lieutenant). A fearless heavy infantryman may be dangerous even at     night. If you don't have enough heavy infantryman to go around, you can     get your initial hits in on a skeleton archer with them and finish him     with a mage. Just keep heavy infantrymen away from dark adepts, and     only let ghouls hit heavy infantrymen if they are on a village (or has     a white mage or other healer next to him), since they can't easily run     away to heal. Also beware walking corpses, which deal a surprising amount     of damage at all times of day since heavy infantrymen can't dodge and     impact damage goes around their resistances, and the ranged cold attack of     ghosts. The biggest problem with heavy infantrymen is they are slow,     which means they're hard to retreat at night and hard to advance in day.     Without shielding units they'll get trapped and killed, and if you have to     shield a unit maybe it should be a mage instead.</p> </li> <li> <p>Horseman: (B) - Because they deal pierce damage, horsemen may not be     very useful when faced with skeletons. However, if your opponent     over-recruits dark adepts, horsemen can be extremely useful, as dark     adepts deal no return damage to the normally risky charge attack.     horsemen can even be used to finish skeleton archers, their nemesis, in     the daytime. However, if your opponent recruits enough skeleton archers     you will have a hard time shielding your horsemen from their devastating     pierce attacks, and skeleton archers are dirt cheap. horsemen can also     one-shot bats and zombies, which can be useful if you need to clear out     a lot of level 0 units quickly. I would want to have at least one horseman     around to keep my opponent from getting too bold with dark adepts, if not     more. Your opponent will be forced to recruit dark adepts if you have     heavy infantrymen in the field.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mage: (A+) mages are an absolute necessity against Undead. If you do     not have mages it will be almost impossible for you to kill ghosts, but     with mages it's a piece of cake. mages are the best unit for killing     almost everything Undead can throw at you, and can even be used to finish     dark adepts in the daytime. Your main problem is that dark adepts are     cheaper and deal almost as much damage, so your opponent can spam dark     adepts while you cannot afford to spam mages. You will also have the     difficult task of shielding fragile, expensive mages against lots of cheap     Undead units. Your opponent will use skeletons and ghouls to attack your     mages when he can, but bats, zombies or just about any other unit will     do for killing your mages in a pinch. Shield your mages well, surround     them with damage soakers and if you can deliver them safely to their targets     you'll be able to clear out the Undead quickly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Merman Fighter: (C-) Mermen make a decent navy against Undead, since     bats and ghosts will have a hard time killing them with their high     defense. Even dark adepts will find Mermen annoying because of their 20%     cold resistance. However, Mermen will have a hard time hurting anything the     Undead have with their lame pierce weapon. Generally Mermen are only good     for holding water hexes and scouting, but don't underestimate how useful     that can be. Some well-placed Mermen on a water map can prevent bats from     sneaking behind your lines and capturing villages or killing injured units.     Even on mostly land maps, a Merman in a river can help hold a defensive     line, or a quick Merman can use a river to slip behind the enemy to trap     dark adepts or other units that are trying to escape at daytime.</p> </li> <li> <p>Spearman: (C-) Spearmen are mostly useful as cheap units for holding     villages and occupying space when faced with dark adepts or skeleton     archers. (You'll want to avoid letting dark adepts hit your heavy     infantrymen because of their vulnerability to cold.) However, you don't     really want spearmen to take hits from dark adepts, it would be better     to let the cold-resistant cavalry absorb the damage. The only units     spearmen are good for attacking are dark adepts and walking corpses.     spearmen are completely useless against skeletons unless you level one     into a swordsman, and even then they're pretty mediocre. However, if there     are lots of skeleton archers you won't be able to use much cavalry or     horsemen, so a spearman or two may be necessary as defenders and damage     soakers even if they are lousy at dealing damage to Undead.</p> </li> </ul>"}, {"location": "wesnoth_loyalist/#loyalists-vs-rebels", "title": "Loyalists vs. Rebels", "text": "<p>Rebels are a very versatile faction like the Loyalists. So you need to counter their versatility with yours. Their weakest trait is low hit-points. That is compensated somewhat by relatively higher defenses and mobility, so you'll need a combination of hard-hitters and speed. mages are also nice for their magical attacks. Anyways, the key for a Loyalist general is to effectively use his hard-hitting units and kill as many units as he can at day. And at night, to defend well as elves ignore the time of day.</p> <p>The smartest thing you can do upon discovering that your opponent is playing Rebels, in multiplayer, is to assume that your opponent has woses and recruit accordingly. woses are a necessary counter to Loyalists' daytime attacks and as soon as your opponent realizes that you are Loyalists he will almost certainly recruit woses. Remember that just because you don't see any woses doesn't mean there aren't a couple hiding in the forest! To fight woses you will need cavalry as meat shields, mages to deal damage, and maybe fencers to get the last hit in. Sadly, cavalry are very vulnerable to elvish archers, so you'll need to make sure that the archers die, which can be difficult if they are in forest. Get horsemen which can one-shot archers (despite their high dodge) and keep up with your cavalry. If one horseman misses, follow up with another one, it's a lucky archer that can dodge 4/4 one-shot attempts. heavy infantrymen are also great against everything but woses and mages, and will reduce the effectiveness of archer spam. spearmen are useless against woses, recruit them sparingly and keep them away from unscouted forest.</p> <p>An alternative way of playing this match up is to maximize the mobility offered by the Loyalists' fastest units, namely the two horse units. By using them to outrun the Rebel units you can achieve some devastating rushes. Some matches require use of both styles of playing. Again, their versatility must be countered with yours.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Bowman: (C-) Rebels in general are effective in both melee and ranged     attacks, so recruiting a ranged unit is less beneficial than most factions     because most of the Rebels' units can retaliate against you. They can be     useful for taking out an Scout or two, but otherwise, this is not really     a smart buy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cavalryman: (B+) A good scout and an effective counter to woses. Watch     out for archers, though, they can really tear horses to shreds. And as     always, they are effective against ranged oriented units like the mage.</p> <p>(A) If you're going for some faster action, cavalrymen are vital in the attack. They do great damage during the day, and combined with their dangerous mobility, they can be a fearsome unit indeed. Just be careful of archers ZoCing you and tearing the unit to shreds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fencer: (B+) The fencer shares the 70% defense in the forest like most     of the elves, but it has negative resistances. Theoretically, they should be     effective against woses, but more often than not woses will crush them     easily. In spite of this, Fencers still have skirmsher, which means that     they can sneak behind an injured unit and finish them off. Do not     over-recruit them, as enemy mages will tear though their high defense.</p> </li> <li> <p>Heavy Infantryman: (C-) Usefulness similar to an archer. It's too slow     to deal with most of the Rebel units, and it is owned by Mages, woses, and     even archers. Even though it has a high damage potential and good     resistances, because of its inherently low defense shamans can easily get     hits on it and turn it into a piece of metal for a turn.</p> </li> <li> <p>Horseman: (B) One horseman may be nice, but no more than that. Enemy     archers will tear them apart and shamans totally mess them up. They're     expensive too. Their greatest use is probably killing mages or an archer     that has gone slightly off-track.</p> <p>(A-) Again, when mobility is required, these units need to come and do serious damage. Since Rebels are mostly comprised of low-hp units, horsemen at day can usually rip them apart. Again be careful of archers, for this unit is worth 23 gold. Shield him properly if he is damaged.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mage: (A-) You'll need these guys to tear though those high elvish     60-70% evasion in the forest; but be careful, archers and shamans will     retaliate and some pretty nasty things may come from that. One purely     positive thing though, they just absolutely destroy woses. 13-3 at day.     Ouch. mages are expensive and fragile though, so keep them protected.</p> </li> <li> <p>Merman Fighter: (B+) If the map has a lot of water, maybe recruit a few     to prevent the Rebel's Mermen Hunters from taking over the waters. Otherwise     they don't really contribute much else.</p> </li> <li> <p>Spearman - A - A necessity. To defend at night, to kill pretty much     anything except for woses, and to be cheap and cost only 14 gold. These     guys pretty much tear though most of the Rebel units, if it were not only     for the high-defense archer and shaman. Get a bunch, and move them like     a wall against the enemy units.</p> </li> </ul> <p>At the start of the game, recruit 1-2 cavalrymen, depending on the map size, 1 mage, (1 merman fighter if you need some water coverage), maybe 1 fencer, and the rest spearman. Later on you maybe can recruit some horseman if you opponent recruits mass mages, or more cavalrymen and mages if he masses woses. Otherwise, spearmen and mages should help you get through most of the match.</p> <p>If you're going for speed, recruit 2-3 cavalrymen, depending on the map, 1 horseman, maybe 1 fencer, and the rest spearmen. Use your spearmen to fill the holes and consolidate the territory that the horses took over. Use the horses to outrun the archers and attack when they can.</p>"}, {"location": "wesnoth_loyalist/#loyalists-vs-northerners", "title": "Loyalists vs Northerners", "text": "<p>The main problem you will have when facing northerners are two things: poison and numbers. If northerners didn't have assassins, it wouldn't be much of a big deal; you could out manoeuvre them with your superior scouting units and skirmishers to grab their villages and then finish them off one by one with spearmen/bowmen. Thing is, assassins poison makes defending at night extremely difficult, and by poisoning your units, they often force you to retreat and heal, or die due to retaliation. The key to winning this match up is to use your superior versatility; the northerners greatest weakness is that ALL of their units are very average and don't often have many special abilities; you have masses. Use your first strike in spearmen to defend against grunts, trolls and wolfriders (even at night), use your magic to finish off wounded assassins, and you can charge any of their wounded units and kill them with one hit. Since all of your units are lawful and theirs are chaotic, you'll want to press your advantage at day and kill as much as possible (but don't attack assassins with bowmen; you don't want to be poisoned and be forced to retreat in your daytime assault). Another problem the northerners have is that all though their units are many in number, they do not have a very high damage per hex ratio. Use this to your advantage; travel in packs and use ZoC lines to prevent your units from being swarmed too easily, and keep your vulnerable units like mages behind damage soakers like spearmen or heavy infantry. If you can, try and make night time defenses near rivers; northerners will hurt themselves when they attack you, as they have low defense in water and are very annoyed by deep water, because it prevents them from easily swarming you.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Spearmen: (A-) Pretty much your best unit against northerners. Their     first strike ability is great in defense and their attack power to cost     ratio is quite high. They also have good health and can retaliate in ranged.     As in many matchups, the bulk of your army.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mage: (B+) The mage is fragile and expensive and has a weak melee     attack, which is the exact opposite of northerners. Not a great defender     unless your opponent goes mad with assassins. However, they have lots of     attack power at day and are very useful for nocking trolls of their     perches and finishing off those damn assassins. You'll want a few of     these, but make sure you keep them protected.</p> </li> <li> <p>Bowmen: (B) Good unit to have. They can attack grunts and trolls     (although you'd want mages to attack trolls) without retaliation, and     can defend against assassins in the night. They can also take out any     wolves that stray too far from the main orchish army. They're not as good as     mages, but they're cheaper and tougher.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cavalryman: (B) cavalryman are superior to their wolves and can hold     ground against grunts and trolls reasonably well. It's also a good idea     if your opponent likes to spam lots of assassins, to let them be the     target of their poison; cavalryman and can run away and heal. Your heavy     infantrymen? Not so much. Beware though, of the cheap orchish archer, as     cavalrymen are weak to pierce.</p> </li> <li> <p>Heavy Infantryman: (B-) Heavy infantryman are heavily resistant to     physical attacks like blade, pierce and to a lesser degree, impact. You'd     think this would make them great units against northerners, if the orchish     archer didn't have a ranged fire attack. heavy infantrymen are also much     too slow too effectively deal with poison, and that's a 19 gold unit that     can't fight. However, they are useful in defense if you opponent hasn't     spammed many archers, and they can even be useful in attack to crush up     injured grunts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Horseman: (B) The horseman is a little controversial in this matchup.     northerners are cheap and melee orientated, which is exactly what horseman     do badly against. They're also quite tough, which means one hit kills are     rare. However, they have one very important advantage over the northerners-     high damage per hex. A horseman is very useful for softening up units or     outright killing them (particularly when paired with a mage) which will be     important in breaking ZoC lines, which can be a real pain with all the units     northerners can field. Get one or two, but no more, else it quickly produces     diminishing returns.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fencer: (C+) The fencer is a melee based unit that is fragile against     blade attacks of grunts, which means they don't have an awful lot of     fighting effectiveness with them. On the other hand, the fencer's skirmisher     ability is really valuable with the many northener units, and can finish off     injured archers or go on sneaky village grabbing incursions. One or two     might be useful, but no more, this unit is not a serious fighter! Make sure     you keep them on 70% terrain if you can as well. Two hitter grunts can     have trouble taking them out.</p> </li> <li> <p>Merman Fighter: (C+) Water based melee unit that doesn't do well against     the orc nagas, recruit only if there's lots of water and keep them in     defendible terrain, else they'll quickly be killed.</p> </li> </ul> <p>As usual, recruit cavalrymen and mermen depending on map (3-4 cavalryman for larger maps, 2-3 for medium sized ones and probably no more than one or two for small maps). Recruit plenty of spearmen and attack at day.</p> <p>Speaking of that, make sure you travel in large groups and do not attack with small numbers even at day. Northerners will swarm you too easily. Also, make sure you don't overextend yourself at day, as northerners do a lot more damage at night. Pay careful attention to your mages, they will be the ones the northerners will be going after, so retreat them quickly. When defending, try to avoid attacking units that can retaliate, unless you have a reasonably high chance of killing them that turn. Avoid attacking trolls if you can't heavily damage them or outright kill them, they're regenaration will quickly mean they can heal from any scratches your bowmen might have dealt them.</p>"}, {"location": "wesnoth_northerners/", "title": "Northerners", "text": "<p>Northerners are a faction of Orcs and their allies who live in the north of the Great Continent, thus their name.

Keeping in mind:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The name of our tests should describe the behaviour that we want to see     from the system.</p> </li> <li> <p>The test level in the testing pyramid should be chosen following the high and low gear metaphor.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Code the domain modeling object:     Choose the objects that match the behavior you are testing keeping in mind:</p> <ul> <li>The names of the classes, methods, functions and variables should be taken     from the business jargon.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"}, {"location": "architecture/domain_driven_design/#domain-modeling-objects", "title": "Domain modeling objects", "text": "<ul> <li> <p>Value object: Any domain object that is uniquely identified by the data it     holds, so it has no conceptual identity.

We don't want infrastructure concerns bleeding over into our domain model and slowing down our unit tests or our ability to make changes. So we'll have an onion architecture.</p> <p></p> <p>If you follow the typical SQLAlchemy tutorial, you'll end up with a \"declarative\" syntax where the model tightly depends on the ORM. The alternative is to make the ORM import the domain model, defining our database tables and columns by using SQLAlchemy's abstractions and magically binding them together with a mapper function.</p> <pre><code>from SQLAlchemy.orm import mapper, relationship\n\nimport model\n\nmetadata = MetaData()\n\ntask = Table(\n    'task', metadata,\n    Colum('id', Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True),\n    Column('description', String(255)),\n    Column('priority', Integer, nullable=False),\n)\n\ndef start_mappers():\n    task_mapper = mapper(model.Task, task)\n</code></pre> <p>The end result is be that, if we call <code>start_mappers</code>, we will be able to easily load and save domain model instances from and to the database. But if we never call that function, our domain model classes stay blissfully unaware of the database.</p> <p>When you're first trying to build your ORM config, it can be useful to write tests for it, though we probably won't keep them around for long once we've got the repository abstraction.</p> <pre><code>def test_task_mapper_can_load_tasks(session):\n    session.execute(\n        'INSERT INTO task (description, priority) VALUES'\n        '(\"First task\", 3),'\n        '(\"Urgent task\", 5),'\n    )\n\n    expected = [\n        model.Task(\"First task\", 3),\n        model.Task(\"Urgent task\", 5),\n    ]\n\n    assert session.query(model.Task).all() == expected\n\ndef test_task_mapper_can_save_lines(session):\n    new_task = model.Task(\"First task\", 3)\n    session.add(new_task)\n    session.commit()\n\n    rows = list(session.execute('SELECT description, priority FROM \"task\"'))\n    assert rows == [(\"First task\", 3)]\n</code></pre> <p>The most basic repository has just two methods: <code>add()</code> to put a new item in the repository, and <code>get()</code> to return a previously added item. We stick to using these methods for data access in our domain and our service layers.</p> <pre><code>import abc\nimport model\n\n\nclass AbstractRepository(abc.ABC):\n\n    @abc.abstractmethod\n    def add(self, task: model.Task):\n        raise NotImplementedError\n\n    @abc.abstractmethod\n    def get(self, reference) -&gt; model.Task:\n        raise NotImplementedError\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>@abc.abstractmethod</code> is one of the only things that makes ABCs actually \"work\" in Python. Python will refuse to let you instantiate a class that does not implement all the <code>abstractmethods</code> defined in its parent class.</p> <p>As always, we start with a test. This would probably be classified as an integration test, since we're checking that our code (the repository) is correctly integrated with the database; hence, the tests tend to mix raw SQL with calls and assertions on our own code.</p> <pre><code># Test .add()\n\ndef test_repository_can_save_a_task(session):\n    task = model.Task(\"First task\", 3)\n\n    repo = repository.SqlAlchemyRepository(session)\n    repo.add(task)\n\n    session.commit()\n\n    rows = list(session.execute(\n        'SELECT description, priority FROM \"tasks\"'\n    ))\n\n    assert rows == [(\"First task\", 3)]\n\n# Test .get()\n\ndef insert_task(session):\n    session.execute(\n        'INSERT INTO tasks (description, priority)'\n        'VALUES (\"First task\", 3)'\n    )\n\n    [[task_id]] = session.execute(\n        'SELECT id FROM tasks WHERE id=:id',\n        dict(id='1'),\n    )\n\n    return task_id\n\ndef test_repository_can_retrieve_a_task(session):\n    task_id = insert_task()\n\n    repo = repository.SqlAlchemyRepository(session)\n    retrieved = repo.get(task_id)\n\n    expected = model.Task('1', 'First task', 3)\n\n    assert retrieved == expected # Task.__eq__ only compares reference\n    assert retrieved.description == expected.description\n    assert retrieved.priority == expected.priority\n</code></pre> <p>Note that we leave the <code>.commit()</code> outside of the repository and make it the responsibility of the caller.</p> <p>Whether or not you write tests for every model is a judgment call.

As the software grew, making modifications became more and more difficult so that even the smallest change would take a redeployment cycle of an hour, which made development nearly impossible.</p> <p>The design problem was that a single Job class was used by almost all of the tasks.

Applied to the Xerox software, an interface layer between the Job class and its clients was added using the Dependency Inversion Principle.

This is because <code>LocalStorage</code> has a lot of advantages over cookies. One of the most important differences is that unlike with cookies, data does not have to be sent back and forth with every HTTP request. This reduces the overall traffic between the client and the server and the amount of wasted bandwidth. This is because data is stored on the user\u2019s local disk and is not destroyed or cleared by the loss of an internet connection. Also, <code>LocalStorage</code> can hold up to 5MB of information which is a whole lot more than the 4KB that cookies hold.</p> <p><code>LocalStorage</code> behaves more like persistent cookies in terms of expiration. Data is not automatically destroyed unless it is cleared through Javascript code. This can be good for larger bits of data that need to be stored for longer periods of time. Also, with <code>LocalStorage</code> you can not only store strings but also Javascript primitives and objects.</p> <p>An example of a good use of <code>LocalStorage</code> might be in an application used in regions without a persistent internet connection. In order for this to be a good use of <code>LocalStorage</code>, the threat level of the data stored in this situation would have to be very low. To protect client privacy, it would be good to upload the data when connection is re-established and then delete the locally stored version.</p> <p>In conclusion, Cookies are smaller and send server information back with every HTTP request, while <code>LocalStorage</code> is larger and can hold information on the client side.</p>"}, {"location": "coding/javascript/javascript/#web-workers", "title": "Web workers", "text": "<p>When executing scripts in an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished.</p> <p>A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page.

It supports the following parameters:</p> <ul> <li><code>default</code>: Default value of the field.</li> <li><code>default_factory</code>: Function that returns the initial value of the field.</li> <li><code>init</code>: Use field in <code>.__init__()</code> method?

The rationale is that there is no need to repeat in many places documentation that is already present in the base method\u2019s docstring. However, if the overriding method\u2019s behavior is substantially different from the overridden method, or details need to be provided (e.g., documenting additional side effects), a docstring with at least those differences is required on the overriding method.</p> <p>Certain aspects of a function should be documented in special sections, listed below. Each section begins with a heading line, which ends with a colon. All sections other than the heading should maintain a hanging indent of two or four spaces (be consistent within a file). These sections can be omitted in cases where the function\u2019s name and signature are informative enough that it can be aptly described using a one-line docstring.</p> Args List each parameter by name. A description should follow the name, and be separated by a colon followed by either a space or newline. If the description is too long to fit on a single 80-character line, use a hanging indent of 2 or 4 spaces more than the parameter name (be consistent with the rest of the docstrings in the file). The description should include required type(s) if the code does not contain a corresponding type annotation. If a function accepts <code>*foo</code> (variable length argument lists) and/or <code>**bar</code> (arbitrary keyword arguments), they should be listed as <code>*foo</code> and <code>**bar</code>. Returns (or Yields: for generators) Describe the type and semantics of the return value. If the function only returns None, this section is not required. It may also be omitted if the docstring starts with Returns or Yields (e.g. <code>\"\"\"Returns row from API as a tuple of strings.\"\"\"</code>) and the opening sentence is sufficient to describe return value. Raises List all exceptions that are relevant to the interface followed by a description. Use a similar exception name + colon + space or newline and hanging indent style as described in Args:. You should not document exceptions that get raised if the API specified in the docstring is violated (because this would paradoxically make behavior under violation of the API part of the API)."}, {"location": "coding/python/docstrings/#tests-docstrings", "title": "Tests docstrings", "text": ""}, {"location": "coding/python/docstrings/#without-template", "title": "Without template", "text": "<p>jml has very good tips on writing test's docstrings:</p> <p>If you\u2019re struggling to write docstrings for your tests, here\u2019s a handy five-step guide:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Write the first docstring that comes to mind.

Keep in mind that since you run the <code>apply</code> to the last of the steps of this long process, the team is blocked by you. So prioritize to commit the next stable version to the version control repository. * Once you've checked that all the desired upgrades are working, change the context to the production cluster and run <code>helmfile --environment=production diff</code>.

(commonly stylized as k8s) is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management.

Many cloud services offer a Kubernetes-based platform or infrastructure as a service (PaaS or IaaS) on which Kubernetes can be deployed as a platform-providing service.  Many vendors also provide their own branded Kubernetes distributions.</p> <p> </p> <p>It has become the standard infrastructure to manage containers in production environments.

It sanitizes your cluster based on what's deployed and not     what's sitting on disk. By scanning your cluster, it detects     misconfigurations and helps you to ensure that best practices are in place,     thus preventing future headaches. It aims at reducing the cognitive overload     one faces when operating a Kubernetes cluster in the wild. Furthermore, if     your cluster employs a metric-server, it reports potential resources     over/under allocations and attempts to warn you should your cluster run out     of capacity.</p> <p>Popeye is a readonly tool, it does not alter any of your Kubernetes resources in any way!</p> </li> <li> <p>Stern allows you to tail multiple pods on     Kubernetes and multiple containers within the pod.

This approach has it\u2019s downsides; we have to update the code for our jobs, we also have to explicitly configure a push gateway location and update it if it changes (a burden alleviated by the pull based metrics for long lived workloads).

What is not shown above is the status of the cronjob. The big challenge with K8s cronjob alerting is that cronjobs themselves do not possess any status information, beyond the last time the cronjob created a job. The status information only exists on the job that the cronjob creates.</p> <p>In order to determine if our cronjob is failing, our first order of business is to find which jobs we should be looking at. A K8s cronjob creates new job objects and keeps a number of them around to help us debug the runs of our jobs. We have to be determine which job corresponds to the last run of our cronjob. If we have added the cron label to the jobs as above, we can find the last run time of the jobs for a given cronjob as follows:</p> <pre><code>max(\nkube_job_status_start_time\n* ON(job_name) GROUP_RIGHT()\nkube_job_labels{label_cron!=\"\"}\n) BY (job_name, label_cron)\n</code></pre> <p>This query demonstrates an important technique when working with <code>kube-state-metrics</code>. For each API object it exported data on, it exports a time series including all the labels for that object. These time series have a value of 1. As such we can join the set of labels for an object onto the metrics about that object by multiplication.</p> <p>Depending on how your Prometheus instance is configured, the value of the job label on your metrics will likely be <code>kube-state-metrics</code>. <code>kube-state-metrics</code> adds a job label itself with the name of the job object. Prometheus resolves this collision of label names by including the raw metric\u2019s label as an <code>job_name</code> label.</p> <p>Since we are querying the start time of jobs, and there should only ever be one job with a given name. You may wonder why we need the max aggregation. Manually plugging the query into Prometheus may convince you that it is unnecessary. Consider though that you may have multiple instances of <code>kube-state-metrics</code> running for redundancy. Using max ensures our query is valid even if we have multiple instances of kube-state-metrics running. Issues of duplicate metrics are common when constructing production recording rules and alerts.</p> <p>We can find the start time of the most recent job for a given cronjob by finding the maximum of all job start times as follows:</p> <pre><code>max(\nkube_job_status_start_time\n* ON(job_name) GROUP_RIGHT()\nkube_job_labels{label_cron!=\"\"}\n) BY (label_cron)\n</code></pre> <p>The only difference between this and the previous query is in the labels used for the aggregation. Now that we have the start time of each job, and the start time of the most recent job, we can do a simple equality match to find the start time of the most recent job for a given cronjob. We will create a metric for this:</p> <pre><code>- record: job_cronjob:kube_job_status_start_time:max\nexpr: |\nsum without (label_cron, job_name) (\nlabel_replace(\nlabel_replace(\nmax(\nkube_job_status_start_time\n* ON(job_name) GROUP_RIGHT()\nkube_job_labels{label_cron!=\"\"}\n) BY (job_name, label_cron)\n\n== ON(label_cron) GROUP_LEFT()\n\nmax(\nkube_job_status_start_time\n* ON(job_name) GROUP_RIGHT()\nkube_job_labels{label_cron!=\"\"}\n) BY (label_cron),\n\"job\", \"$1\", \"job_name\", \"(.+)\"\n),\n\"cronjob\", \"$1\", \"label_cron\", \"(.+)\"\n)\n)\n</code></pre> <p>We have also taken the opportunity to adjust the labels to be a little more aesthetically pleasing. By copying <code>job_name</code> to <code>job</code>, <code>label_cron</code> to <code>cronjob</code> and removing <code>job_name</code> and <code>label_cron</code>. Now that we have the most recently started job for a given cronjob, we can find which, if any, have failed attempts:</p> <pre><code>- record: job_cronjob:kube_job_status_failed:sum\nexpr: |\nsum without (label_cron, job_name) (\nclamp_max(\njob_cronjob:kube_job_status_start_time:max,\n1\n)\n\n* ON(job) GROUP_LEFT()\n\nlabel_replace(\nlabel_replace(\n(\nkube_job_status_failed != 0 and\nkube_job_status_succeeded == 0\n),\n\"job\", \"$1\", \"job_name\", \"(.+)\"\n),\n\"cronjob\", \"$1\", \"label_cron\", \"(.+)\"\n)\n)\n</code></pre> <p>The initial <code>clamp_max</code> clause is used to transform our start times metric into a set of time series to perform label matching to filter another set of metrics. Multiplication by 1 (or addition of 0), is a useful means of filter and merging time series and it is well worth taking the time to understand the technique.</p> <p>We get those cronjobs that have a failed job and no successful ones with the query:</p> <pre><code>(\nkube_job_status_failed != 0 and\nkube_job_status_succeeded == 0\n)\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>kube_job_status_succeeded == 0</code> it's important, otherwise once a job has a failed instance, it doesn't matter if there's a posterior one that succeeded, we're going to keep on receiving the alert that it failed.</p> <p>We adjust the labels on the previous query to match our start time metric so ensure the labels have the same meaning as those on our <code>job_cronjob:kube_job_status_start_time:max</code> metric. The label matching on the multiplication will then perform our filtering. We now have a metric containing the set of most recently failed jobs, labeled by their parent cronjob, so we can now construct the alert:</p> <pre><code>- alert: CronJobStatusFailed\nexpr: job_cronjob:kube_job_status_failed:sum &gt; 0\nfor: 1m\nannotations:\ndescription: '{{ $labels.cronjob }} last run has failed {{ $value }} times.'\n</code></pre> <p>We use the <code>kube_cronjob_labels</code> here to merge in labels from the original cronjob.</p>"}, {"location": "devops/kubernetes/kubernetes_labels/", "title": "Kubernetes Labels", "text": "<p>Labels are identifying metadata key/value pairs attached to objects, such as pods.

It is one of the most mature examples of networking fabric for container orchestration systems, intended to allow for better inter-container and inter-host networking. As the CNI concept took off, a CNI plugin for Flannel was an early entry.</p> <p>Flannel is relatively easy to install and configure. It is packaged as a single binary called flanneld and can be installed by default by many common Kubernetes cluster deployment tools and in many Kubernetes distributions. Flannel can use the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s existing etcd cluster to store its state information using the API to avoid having to provision a dedicated data store.</p> <p>Flannel configures a layer 3 IPv4 overlay network. A large internal network is created that spans across every node within the cluster. Within this overlay network, each node is given a subnet to allocate IP addresses internally. As pods are provisioned, the Docker bridge interface on each node allocates an address for each new container. Pods within the same host can communicate using the Docker bridge, while pods on different hosts will have their traffic encapsulated in UDP packets by flanneld for routing to the appropriate destination.</p> <p>Flannel has several different types of backends available for encapsulation and routing. The default and recommended approach is to use VXLAN, as it offers both good performance and is less manual intervention than other options.</p> <p>Overall, Flannel is a good choice for most users. From an administrative perspective, it offers a simple networking model that sets up an environment that\u2019s suitable for most use cases when you only need the basics. In general, it\u2019s a safe bet to start out with Flannel until you need something that it cannot provide or you need security features, such as NetworkPolicies or encryption.</p> <p>It's also recommended if you have low resource nodes in your cluster (only a few GB of RAM, a few cores). Moreover, it is compatible with a very large number of architectures (amd64, arm, arm64, etc.). It is the only one, along with Cilium, that is able to correctly auto-detect your MTU, so you don\u2019t have to configure anything to let it work.</p>"}, {"location": "devops/kubernetes/kubernetes_networking/#calico", "title": "Calico", "text": "<p>Calico, is another popular networking option in the Kubernetes ecosystem. While Flannel is positioned as the simple choice, Calico is best known for its performance, flexibility, and power. Calico takes a more holistic view of networking, concerning itself not only with providing network connectivity between hosts and pods, but also with network security and administration.</p> <p>On a freshly provisioned Kubernetes cluster that meets the system requirements, Calico can be deployed quickly by applying a single manifest file. If you are interested in Calico\u2019s optional network policy capabilities, you can enable them by applying an additional manifest to your cluster.</p> <p>Unlike Flannel, Calico does not use an overlay network. Instead, Calico configures a layer 3 network that uses the BGP routing protocol to route packets between hosts. This means that packets do not need to be wrapped in an extra layer of encapsulation when moving between hosts. The BGP routing mechanism can direct packets natively without an extra step of wrapping traffic in an additional layer of traffic.</p> <p>Besides the performance that this offers, one side effect of this is that it allows for more conventional troubleshooting when network problems arise. While encapsulated solutions using technologies like VXLAN work well, the process manipulates packets in a way that can make tracing difficult. With Calico, the standard debugging tools have access to the same information they would in simple environments, making it easier for a wider range of developers and administrators to understand behavior.</p> <p>In addition to networking connectivity, Calico is well known for its advanced network features. Network policy is one of its most sought after capabilities. In addition, Calico can also integrate with Istio, a service mesh, to interpret and enforce policy for workloads within the cluster both at the service mesh layer and the network infrastructure layer. This means that you can configure powerful rules describing how pods should be able to send and accept traffic, improving security and control over your networking environment.</p> <p>Project Calico is a good choice for environments that support its requirements and when performance and features like network policy are important. Additionally, Calico offers commercial support if you\u2019re seeking a support contract or want to keep that option open for the future.

As the contributors worked through the details however, it became apparent that a full integration was not necessarily needed if work was done on both projects to ensure standardization and flexibility. As a result, the official project became somewhat defunct, but the intended ability to deploy the two technology together was achieved. For this reason, it\u2019s still sometimes easiest to refer to the combination as \u201cCanal\u201d even if the project no longer exists.</p> <p>Because Canal is a combination of Flannel and Calico, its benefits are also at the intersection of these two technologies. The networking layer is the simple overlay provided by Flannel that works across many different deployment environments without much additional configuration. The network policy capabilities layered on top supplement the base network with Calico\u2019s powerful networking rule evaluation to provide additional security and control.</p> <p>After ensuring that the cluster fulfills the necessary system requirements, Canal can be deployed by applying two manifests, making it no more difficult to configure than either of the projects on their own. Canal is a good way for teams to start to experiment and gain experience with network policy before they\u2019re ready to experiment with changing their actual networking.</p> <p>In general, Canal is a good choice if you like the networking model that Flannel provides but find some of Calico\u2019s features enticing. The ability define network policy rules is a huge advantage from a security perspective and is, in many ways, Calico\u2019s killer feature.

Weave creates a mesh overlay network between each of the nodes in the cluster, allowing for flexible routing between participants. This, coupled with a few other unique features, allows Weave to intelligently route in situations that might otherwise cause problems.</p> <p>To create its network, Weave relies on a routing component installed on each host in the network. These routers then exchange topology information to maintain an up-to-date view of the available network landscape. When looking to send traffic to a pod located on a different node, the weave router makes an automatic decision whether to send it via \u201cfast datapath\u201d or to fall back on the \u201csleeve\u201d packet forwarding method.</p> <p>Fast datapath is an approach that relies on the kernel\u2019s native Open vSwitch datapath module to forward packets to the appropriate pod without moving in and out of userspace multiple times. The Weave router updates the Open vSwitch configuration to ensure that the kernel layer has accurate information about how to route incoming packets. In contrast, sleeve mode is available as a backup when the networking topology isn\u2019t suitable for fast datapath routing. It is a slower encapsulation mode that can route packets in instances where fast datapath does not have the necessary routing information or connectivity. As traffic flows through the routers, they learn which peers are associated with which MAC addresses, allowing them to route more intelligently with fewer hops for subsequent traffic. This same mechanism helps each node self-correct when a network change alters the available routes.</p> <p>Like Calico, Weave also provides network policy capabilities for your cluster. This is automatically installed and configured when you set up Weave, so no additional configuration is necessary beyond adding your network rules. One thing that Weave provides that the other options do not is easy encryption for the entire network. While it adds quite a bit of network overhead, Weave can be configured to automatically encrypt all routed traffic by using NaCl encryption for sleeve traffic and, since it needs to encrypt VXLAN traffic in the kernel, IPsec ESP for fast datapath traffic.</p> <p>Another advantage of Weave is that it's the only CNI that supports multicast. In case you need it.</p> <p>Weave is a great option for those looking for feature rich encrypted networking without adding a large amount of complexity or management at the expense of worse overall performance.  It is relatively easy to set up, offers many built in and automatically configured features, and can provide routing in scenarios where other solutions might fail. The mesh topography does put a limit on the size of the network that can be reasonably accommodated, but for most users, this won\u2019t be a problem. Additionally, Weave offers paid support for organizations that prefer to be able to have someone to contact for help and troubleshooting.</p>"}, {"location": "devops/kubernetes/kubernetes_networking/#aws-cni", "title": "AWS CNI", "text": "<p>AWS developed their own CNI that uses Elastic Network Interfaces for pod networking.</p> <p>It's the default CNI if you use EKS.</p>"}, {"location": "devops/kubernetes/kubernetes_networking/#advantages-of-the-aws-cni", "title": "Advantages of the AWS CNI", "text": "<p>Amazon native networking provides a number of significant advantages over some of the more traditional overlay network solutions for Kubernetes:</p> <ul> <li>Raw AWS network performance.</li> <li>Integration of tools familiar to AWS developers and admins, like AWS VPC flow   logs and Security Groups \u2014 allowing users with existing VPC networks and   networking best practices to carry those over directly to Kubernetes.</li> <li>The ability to enforce network policy decisions at the Kubernetes layer if you   install Calico.</li> </ul> <p>If your team has significant experience with AWS networking, and/or your application is sensitive to network performance all of this makes VPC CNI very attractive.</p>"}, {"location": "devops/kubernetes/kubernetes_networking/#disadvantages-of-the-aws-cni", "title": "Disadvantages of the AWS CNI", "text": "<p>On the other hand, there are a couple of limitations that may be significant to you.

Each of these uses an IP address per node.</p> <p>So now the formula is:</p> <pre><code>(ENIs * (IPs_per_ENI - 1) - 1 * DaemonSets\n</code></pre> <p>This makes some of the cheaper instances on Amazon completely unusable because there are no IP addresses left for application pods.</p> <p>On the other hand, Kubernetes itself has a supported limit of 100 pods per node, making some of the larger instances with lots of available addresses less attractive. However, the pod per node limit IS configurable, and in my experience, this limit can be increased without much increase in Kubernetes overhead.</p> <p>Weave people made a quick Google sheet with each of the Amazon instance types, and the maximum pod densities for each based on the VPC CNI network plugin restrictions:</p> <ul> <li>A 100 pod/node limit setting in Kubernetes,</li> <li>A default of 4 DaemonSets (2 for AWS networking, 1 for log aggregation, and   1 for metric collection),</li> <li>A simple cost calculation for per-pod pricing.</li> </ul> <p>This sheet is not intended to provide a definitive answer on pod economics for AWS VPC based Kubernetes clusters. There are a number of important caveats to the use of this sheet:</p> <ul> <li>CPU and memory requirements will often dictate lower pod density than the   theoretical maximum here.</li> <li>Beyond DaemonSets, Kubernetes System pods, and other \u201csystem level\u201d   operational tools used in your cluster will consume Pod IP\u2019s and limit the   number of application pods that you can run.</li> <li>Each instance type also has network performance limitations which may impact   performance often far before theoretical pod limits are reached.</li> </ul>"}, {"location": "devops/kubernetes/kubernetes_networking/#cloud-portability", "title": "Cloud Portability", "text": "<p>Hybrid cloud, disaster recovery, and other requirements often push users away from custom cloud vendor solutions and towards open solutions.</p> <p>However, in this case the level of lock-in is quite low.

As an example, the built-in ReplicaSet resource lets users set a desired number number of Pods to run, and controllers inside Kubernetes ensure the desired state set in the ReplicaSet resource remains true by creating or removing running Pods.

It records real-time metrics in a time series database (allowing for high dimensionality) built using a HTTP pull model, with flexible queries and real-time alerting. The project is written in Go and licensed under the Apache 2 License, with source code available on GitHub, and is a graduated project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, along with Kubernetes and Envoy.</p> <p> </p> <p>A quick overview of Prometheus would be, as stated in the coreos article:</p> <p>At the core of the Prometheus monitoring system is the main server, which ingests samples from monitoring targets. A target is any application that exposes metrics according to the open specification understood by Prometheus. Since Prometheus pulls data, rather than expecting targets to actively push stats into the monitoring system, it supports a variety of service discovery integrations, like that with Kubernetes, to immediately adapt to changes in the set of targets.</p> <p>The second core component is the Alertmanager, implementing the idea of time series based alerting. It intelligently removes duplicate alerts sent by Prometheus servers, groups the alerts into informative notifications, and dispatches them to a variety of integrations, like those with PagerDuty and Slack. It also handles silencing of selected alerts and advanced routing configurations for notifications.</p> <p>There are several additional Prometheus components, such as client libraries for different programming languages, and a growing number of exporters. Exporters are small programs that provide Prometheus compatible metrics from systems that are not natively instrumented.</p> <p>Go to the Prometheus architecture post for more details.</p> <p>We are living a shift to the DevOps culture, containers and Kubernetes. So nowadays:</p> <ul> <li>Developers need to integrate app and business related metrics as an organic   part of the infrastructure. So monitoring needs to be democratized, made more   accessible and cover additional layers of the stack.</li> <li>Container based infrastructures are changing how we monitor the resources.   Now we have a huge number of volatile software entities, services, virtual   network addresses, exposed metrics that suddenly appear or vanish. Traditional   monitoring tools are not designed to handle this.</li> </ul> <p>These reasons pushed Soundcloud to build a new monitoring system that had the following features</p> <ul> <li>Multi-dimensional data model: The model is based on key-value pairs, similar   to how Kubernetes itself organizes infrastructure metadata using labels. It   allows for flexible and accurate time series data, powering its Prometheus   query language.</li> <li>Accessible format and protocols: Exposing prometheus metrics is a pretty   straightforward task. Metrics are human readable, are in a self-explanatory   format, and are published using a standard HTTP transport. You can check that   the metrics are correctly exposed just using your web browser.</li> <li>Service discovery: The Prometheus server is in charge of periodically   scraping the targets, so that applications and services don\u2019t need to worry   about emitting data (metrics are pulled, not pushed). These Prometheus servers   have several methods to auto-discover scrape targets, some of them can be   configured to filter and match container metadata, making it an excellent fit   for ephemeral Kubernetes workloads.</li> <li>Modular and highly available components: Metric collection, alerting,   graphical visualization, etc, are performed by different composable services.   All these services are designed to support redundancy and sharding.</li> <li>Pull based metrics: Most monitoring systems are pushing metrics to     a centralized collection platform. Prometheus flips this model on it's head     with the following advantages:<ul> <li>No need to install custom software in the physical servers or containers.</li> <li>Doesn't require applications to use CPU cycles pushing metrics.</li> <li>Handles service failure/unavailability gracefully. If a target goes down,     Prometheus can record it was unable to retrieve data.</li> <li>You can use the Pushgateway if pulling metrics is not feasible.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"}, {"location": "devops/prometheus/prometheus/#installation", "title": "Installation", "text": "<p>There are several ways to install prometheus, but I'd recommend using the Kubernetes or Docker Prometheus operator.</p>"}, {"location": "devops/prometheus/prometheus/#exposing-your-metrics", "title": "Exposing your metrics", "text": "<p>Prometheus defines a very nice text-based format for its metrics:</p> <pre><code># HELP prometheus_engine_query_duration_seconds Query timings\n# TYPE prometheus_engine_query_duration_seconds summary\nprometheus_engine_query_duration_seconds{slice=\"inner_eval\",quantile=\"0.5\"} 7.0442e-05\nprometheus_engine_query_duration_seconds{slice=\"inner_eval\",quantile=\"0.9\"} 0.0084092\nprometheus_engine_query_duration_seconds{slice=\"inner_eval\",quantile=\"0.99\"} 0.389403939\n</code></pre> <p>The data is relatively human readable and we even have TYPE and HELP decorators to increase the readability.</p> <p>To expose application metrics to the Prometheus server, use one of the client libraries and follow the suggested naming and units conventions for metrics.</p>"}, {"location": "devops/prometheus/prometheus/#metric-types", "title": "Metric types", "text": "<p>There are these metric types:</p> <ul> <li>Counter: A simple monotonically incrementing type; basically use this for   situations where you want to know \u201chow many times has x happened\u201d.</li> <li>Gauge: A representation of a metric that can go both up and down.

The Grafana dashboard paints a count of all the triggers with a big red number, which may scare you at first.</p> <p>Lets first understand what are Circuit Breakers. Elasticsearch is built with Java and as such depends on the JVM heap for many operations and caching purposes. By default in AWS, each data node is assigned half the RAM to be used for heap for ES. In Elasticsearch the default Garbage Collector is Concurrent-Mark and Sweep (CMS). When the JVM Memory Pressure reaches 75%, this collector pauses some threads and attempts to reclaim some heap space. High heap usage occurs when the garbage collection process cannot keep up. An indicator of high heap usage is when the garbage collection is incapable of reducing the heap usage to around 30%.</p> <p>When a request reaches the ES nodes, circuit breakers estimate the amount of memory needed to load the required data. The cluster then compares the estimated size with the configured heap size limit. If the estimated size of your data is greater than the available heap size, the query is terminated. As a result, a CircuitBreakerException is thrown to prevent overloading the node.</p> <p>In essence, these breakers are present to prevent a request overloading a data node and consuming more heap space than that node can provide at that time. If these breakers weren't present, then the request will use up all the heap that the node can provide and this node will then restart due to OOM.</p> <p>Lets assume a data node has 16GB heap configured, When the parent circuit breaker is tripped, then a similar error is thrown:</p> <pre><code>\"error\": {\n\"root_cause\": [\n{\n\"type\": \"circuit_breaking_exception\",\n\"reason\": \"[parent] Data too large, data for [&lt;HTTP_request&gt;] would be [16355096754/15.2gb], which is larger than the limit of [16213167308/15gb], real usage: [15283269136/14.2gb], new bytes reserved: [1071827618/1022.1mb]\",\n}\n]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The parent circuit breaker (a circuit breaker type) is responsible for the overall memory usage of your Elasticsearch cluster. When a parent circuit breaker exception occurs, the total memory used across all circuit breakers has exceeded the set limit. A parent breaker throws an exception when the cluster exceeds 95% of 16 GB, which is 15.2 GB of heap (in above example).</p> <p>A circuit breaking exception is generally caused by high JVM. When the JVM Memory Pressure is high, it indicates that a large portion of one or more data nodes configured heap is currently being used heavily, and as such, the frequency of the circuit breakers being tripped increases as there is not enough heap available at the time to process concurrent smaller or larger requests.</p> <p>It is worth noting that that the error can also be thrown by a certain request that would just consume all the available heap on a certain data node at the time such as an intensive search query.</p> <p>If you see numerous spikes to the high 90%, with occasionally spikes to 100%, it's not uncommon for the parent circuit breaker to be tripped in response to requests.</p> <p>To troubleshoot circuit breakers, you'll then have to address the High JVM issues, which can be caused by:</p> <ul> <li>Increase in the number of requests to the cluster. Check the IndexRate and   SearchRate metrics in to determine your current load.</li> <li>Aggregation, wildcards, and using wide time ranges in your queries.</li> <li>Unbalanced shard allocation across nodes or too many shards in a cluster.</li> <li>Index mapping explosions.</li> <li>Using the fielddata data structure to query data. Fielddata can consume a   large amount of heap space, and remains in the heap for the lifetime of a   segment. As a result, JVM memory pressure remains high on the cluster when   fielddata is used.</li> </ul> <p>Here's what happens as JVM memory pressure increases in AWS:</p> <ul> <li>At 75%: Amazon ES triggers the Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) garbage collector.   The CMS collector runs alongside other processes to keep pauses and   disruptions to a minimum. The garbage collection is a CPU-intensive process.   If JVM memory pressure stays at this percentage for a few minutes, then you   could encounter ClusterBlockException, JVM OutOfMemoryError, or other cluster   performance issues.</li> <li>Above 75%: If the CMS collector fails to reclaim enough memory and usage   remains above 75%, Amazon ES triggers a different garbage collection   algorithm. This algorithm tries to free up memory and prevent a JVM   OutOfMemoryError (OOM) exception by slowing or stopping processes.</li> <li>Above 92% for 30 minutes: Amazon ES blocks all write operations.</li> <li>Around 95%: Amazon ES kills processes that try to allocate memory. If a   critical process is killed, one or more cluster nodes might fail.</li> <li>At 100%: Amazon ES JVM is configured to exit and eventually restarts on   OutOfMemory (OOM).</li> </ul> <p>To resolve high JVM memory pressure, try the following tips:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Reduce incoming traffic to your cluster, especially if you have a heavy   workload.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider scaling the cluster to obtain more JVM memory to support your   workload. As mentioned above each data node gets half the RAM allocated to be   used as Heap. Consider scaling to a data node type with more RAM and hence   more Available Heap. Thereby increasing the parent circuit breaker limit.</p> </li> <li> <p>If cluster scaling isn't possible, try reducing the number of shards by   deleting old or unused indices. Because shard metadata is stored in memory,   reducing the number of shards can reduce overall memory usage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enable slow logs to identify faulty requests. Note: Before enabling   configuration changes, verify that JVM memory pressure is below 85%. This way,   you can avoid additional overhead to existing resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Optimize search and indexing requests, and choose the correct number of   shards.</p> </li> <li> <p>Disable and avoid using fielddata. By default, fielddata is set to \"false\" on   a text field unless it's explicitly defined as otherwise in index mappings.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Field data is a potentially a huge consumer of JVM Heap space. This build up   of field data occurs when aggregations are run on fields that are of type   <code>text</code>. More on how you can periodically clear field data below.</p> <ul> <li>Change your index mapping type to a <code>keyword</code>, using reindex API. You can use   the <code>keyword</code> type as an alternative for performing aggregations and sorting   on text fields.</li> </ul> <p>As mentioned in above point, by aggregating on <code>keyword</code> type instead of   <code>text</code>, no field data has to be built on demand and hence won't consume   precious heap space. Look into the commonly aggregated fields in index   mappings and ensure they are not of type <code>text</code>.</p> <p>If they are, you can consider changing them to <code>keyword</code>. You will have to   create a new index with the desired mapping and then use the Reindex API to   transfer over the documents from the source index to the new index. Once   Re-index has completed then you can delete the old index.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Avoid aggregating on text fields to prevent increases in field data. When you   use more field data, more heap space is consumed. Use the cluster stats API   operation to check your field data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Clear the fielddata cache with the following API call:</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>POST /index_name/_cache/clear?fielddata=true (index-level cache)\nPOST */_cache/clear?fielddata=true (cluster-level cache)\n</code></pre> <p>Generally speaking, if you notice your workload (search rate and index rate) remaining consistent during these high spikes and non of the above optimizations can be applied or if they have already been applied and the JVM is still high during these workload times, then it is an indication that the cluster needs to be scaled in terms of JVM resources to cope with this workload.</p> <p>You can't reset the 'tripped' count. This is a Node level metric and thus will be reset to <code>0</code> when the Elasticsearch Service is restarted on that Node. Since in AWS it's a managed service, unfortunately you will not have access to the underlaying EC2 instance to restart the ES Process.</p> <p>However the ES Process can be restarted on your end (on all nodes) in the following ways:</p> <ul> <li>Initiate a Configuration Change that causes a blue/green deployment : When you   initiate a configuration change, a subsequent blue/green deployment process is   launched in which we launch a new fleet that matches the desired   configuration. The old fleet continues to run and serve requests.   Simultaneously, data in the form of shards are then migrated from the old   fleet to the new fleet. Once all this data has been migrated the old fleet is   terminated and the new one takes over.</li> </ul> <p>During this process ES is restarted on the Nodes.</p> <p>Ensure that CPU Utilization and JVM Memory Pressure are below the recommended   80% thresholds to prevent any issues with this process as it uses clusters   resources to initiate and complete.</p> <p>You can scale the EBS Volumes attached to the data nodes by an arbitrary   amount such as 1GB, wait for the blue/green to complete and then scale it   back.</p> <ul> <li>Wait for a new service software release and update the service software of the   Cluster.</li> </ul> <p>This will also cause a blue/green and hence ES process will be restarted on   the nodes.</p>"}, {"location": "linux/elasticsearch/#recover-from-yellow-state", "title": "Recover from yellow state", "text": "<p>A yellow cluster represents that some of the replica shards in the cluster are unassigned.

In other words, a proxy is associated with the client(s), while a reverse proxy is associated with the server(s); a reverse proxy is usually an internal-facing proxy used as a 'front-end' to control and protect access to a server on a private network.</p> <p>It can be done at Web server level (Nginx, Apache, ...) or at load balancer level.</p> <p>This HAProxy post shows how to translate Apache's proxy pass directives to the HAProxy configuration.</p> <pre><code>    frontend ft_global\n     acl host_dom.com    req.hdr(Host) dom.com\n     acl path_mirror_foo path -m beg   /mirror/foo/\n     use_backend bk_myapp if host_dom.com path_mirror_foo\n    backend bk_myapp\n    [...]\n    # external URL                  =&gt; internal URL\n    # http://dom.com/mirror/foo/bar =&gt; http://bk.dom.com/bar\n     # ProxyPass /mirror/foo/ http://bk.dom.com/bar\n     http-request set-header Host bk.dom.com\n     reqirep  ^([^ :]*)\\ /mirror/foo/(.*)     \\1\\ /\\2\n     # ProxyPassReverse /mirror/foo/ http://bk.dom.com/bar\n     # Note: we turn the urls into absolute in the mean time\n     acl hdr_location res.hdr(Location) -m found\n     rspirep ^Location:\\ (https?://bk.dom.com(:[0-9]+)?)?(/.*) Location:\\ /mirror/foo3 if hdr_location\n     # ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain bk.dom.com dom.com\n     acl hdr_set_cookie_dom res.hdr(Set-cookie) -m sub Domain= bk.dom.com\n     rspirep ^(Set-Cookie:.*)\\ Domain=bk.dom.com(.*) \\1\\ Domain=dom.com\\2 if hdr_set_cookie_dom\n     # ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain / /mirror/foo/\n     acl hdr_set_cookie_path res.hdr(Set-cookie) -m sub Path=\n     rspirep ^(Set-Cookie:.*)\\ Path=(.*) \\1\\ Path=/mirror/foo2 if hdr_set_cookie_path\n</code></pre> <p>Other useful examples can be retrieved from drmalex07  or ferdinandosimonetti gists.</p>"}, {"location": "linux/haproxy/#references", "title": "References", "text": "<ul> <li>Guidelines for HAProxy termination in AWS</li> </ul>"}, {"location": "linux/hypothesis/", "title": "Hypothesis", "text": "<p>Hypothesis is an open-source software project that aims to collect comments about statements made in any web-accessible content, and filter and rank those comments to assess each statement's credibility.</p> <p>It offers an online web application where registered users share highlights and annotations over any webpage.</p> <p>As of 2020-06-11, although the service can be self-hosted, it's not yet easy to do so.</p>"}, {"location": "linux/hypothesis/#install", "title": "Install", "text": ""}, {"location": "linux/hypothesis/#client", "title": "Client", "text": "<p>If you're using Chrome or any derivative there is an official extension.</p> <p>Unfortunately if you use Firefox the extension is still being developed #310 although an unofficial release works just fine.

As I understood from the docs, the files should be created in the <code>on_files</code> event. the problem with this approach is that the only event that allows you to change the <code>config</code> is the <code>on_config</code> event, which is before the <code>on_files</code> one, so you can't build the navigation this way after you've created the files.</p> <p>Next idea was to add the items in the <code>on_nav</code> event, that means creating yourself the <code>Section</code>, <code>Pages</code>, <code>SectionPages</code> or <code>Link</code> objects and append them to the <code>nav.items</code>. The problem is that MkDocs initializes and processes the <code>Navigation</code> object in the <code>get_navigation</code> function. If you want to add items with a plugin in the <code>on_nav</code> event, you need to manually run all the post processing functions such as building the <code>pages</code> attribute, by running the <code>_get_by_type</code>, <code>_add_previous_and_next_links</code> or <code>_add_parent_links</code> yourself. Additionally, when building the site you'll get the <code>The following pages exist in the docs directory, but are not included in the \"nav\" configuration</code> error, because that check is done before all plugins change the navigation in the <code>on_nav</code> object.</p> <p>The last approach is to build the files and tweak the navigation in the <code>on_config</code> event. This approach has the next advantages:</p> <ul> <li>You need less knowledge of how MkDocs works.</li> <li>You don't need to create the <code>File</code> or <code>Files</code> objects.</li> <li>You don't need to create the <code>Page</code>, <code>Section</code>, <code>SectionPage</code> objects.</li> <li>More robust as you rely on existent MkDocs functionality.</li> </ul>"}, {"location": "linux/mkdocs/#testing", "title": "Testing", "text": "<p>I haven't found any official documentation on how to test MkDocs plugins, in the issues they suggest you look at how they test it in the search plugin.

Initially released for the Linux kernel, it's now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely deployable. Although it's under heavy development, it already might be the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in the industry.</p> <p>Features:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Simple and easy to use: WireGuard aims to be as easy to configure and deploy     as SSH.

It makes conservative and     reasonable choices and has been reviewed by cryptographers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Minimal Attack Surface: WireGuard is designed with ease-of-implementation and     simplicity in mind.

Compared to behemoths like     *Swan/IPsec or OpenVPN/OpenSSL, in which auditing the gigantic codebases is     an overwhelming task even for large teams of security experts, WireGuard is     meant to be comprehensively reviewable by single individuals.</p> </li> <li> <p>High Performance: A combination of extremely high-speed cryptographic     primitives and the fact that WireGuard lives inside the Linux kernel means     that secure networking can be very high-speed.

The answer to that is easy: terminal punctuation, i.e. a full stop, question mark or exclamation mark. There's a visual clue in that <code>?</code> and <code>!</code> are decorated full stops; you just have to remember that a colon (<code>:</code>) isn't really a decorated full stop, not that you'd ever know by looking at it. Colons, semicolons and commas aren't terminal punctuation, so they don't end a sentence and so don't force the next letter to be a capital. It may be a capital letter for some other reason such as being the start of a proper name, but not because it is starting a sentence.</p> <p>There are exceptions to this rule, occasions when <code>?</code> and <code>!</code> become non terminal punctuation. The most obvious is in quoted speech: if the speaker asks a question or makes an exclamation, the <code>?</code> or <code>!</code> doesn't have to be terminal if the sentence carries on after the quote.</p> <p>\"Should I write it like this?\" he asked. \"Or perhaps like this?\"</p> <p>The other class of exception is for what are probably really parenthetical comments. If you have a short phrase that you could have put aside in parentheses or dashes, then a question mark or exclamation mark can be used at the end of that phrase without ending the sentence. Be sparing with this. It looks wrong at a first read.</p> <p>Should I write it like this, or abracadabra! like this?</p> <p>When joining many questions you might may have the doubt of which of the following is correct:</p> <p>Should I write it like this? Or perhaps like this? Should I write it like this? or perhaps like this? Should I write it like this, or perhaps like that? \"Should I write it like this?\" he asked, \"or perhaps like that?\"</p> <p>The second with the lowercase <code>or</code> is just plain wrong.</p> <p>Crusty old grammarians who disapprove of starting sentences with conjunctions may frown at example 1 all they like, but it's a perfectly acceptable fragmentary sentence. Whether it's the right answer or not is another question entirely. Example 1 makes the point that the questions are distinct, though they are strongly linked otherwise the whole structure wouldn't work.</p> <p>Example 3 on the other hand emphasizes that the two questions are options in a common situation, as well as reflecting a different way of saying them. That is clear in this case because the two questions are tightly coupled alternatives. However, consider the following:</p> <p>Are the lights green? Or is the switch up? Are the lights green, or is the switch up?</p> <p>Both of these examples imply that the state of the lights and the state of the switch are related somehow. Version 2 couples them more tightly; I would usually assume (without more context) that either this is the same question being asked in two different ways (i.e. that the switch being up should cause the lights to be green), or that they are an exhaustive list of possibilities (either the switch is up or the lights are green, but not both or neither). This isn't an absolute rule, but it's quite strongly implied.</p> <p>Example 4 is also wrong, though it has a better disguise. If you unwrap the quotes, what you get is:</p> <p>Should I write it like this? or perhaps like this?</p> <p>Which is example 2 back again. What you actually want is one of:</p> <p>\"Should I write it like this?\" he asked. \"Or perhaps like this?\" (i.e. example 1) \"Should I write it like this,\" he asked, \"or perhaps like that? (i.e. example 3)</p> <p>Exclamation marks work like question marks for this purpose.
